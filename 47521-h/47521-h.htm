<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="centre">&mdash;&mdash;&#9830;&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<p>If there be a story which may be supposed to be thoroughly familiar
to the reading public, it is surely that of the Queen of Denmark, who is
believed to have loved not wisely but too well. The fate of Struensee
has supplied the motive for countless works more or less historical, for
novels, and even for an opera. Hence it might reasonably be assumed that
the man who ventured on intruding on the English public another work
on such a thoroughly worn-out topic, must be either very impudent or
very foolish; and yet I have ventured to do so through neither of these
failings, but for reasons which have been duly weighed, and which appear
to my mind to convey their justification.</p>

<p>The first of these motives is, that within a very recent period a
perfectly new light has been thrown on the whole affair, by permission
being granted to examine the privy archives of Copenhagen. From these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
I have been enabled to derive the hitherto unpublished documents and
reports of the judges, and thus prove on what worthless evidence the
divorce of the queen was passed. At the same time, a great deal of fresh
matter has been rendered available about the two unhappy men who fell
victims to a mistaken sense of justice.</p>

<p>The late King of Denmark, who wisely thought that publicity was the
best safeguard of thrones, also allowed the "Mémoires de mon Temps"
of the Landgrave Charles of Hesse Cassel, brother-in-law of Christian
VII., to be printed for private circulation. I have been enabled to
procure a copy of this work through the kindness of Baron von <span
class="smcap">Jenssen Tusch</span>, who obtained it from the Prince
of Augustenburg; and the many curious details of the Court of Denmark
it contains have been woven largely into my text. Another work which
has afforded me very material assistance is the "Memoirs of Reverdil,
Secretary to Christian VII.," which appeared two or three years ago, but
is little known in this country.</p>

<p>Lastly, the private journals of Sir N. W. Wraxall have been laid under
contribution to a great extent. It was made known by the publication of the "Post-humous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
Memoirs" that he had been connected with the Queen of Denmark, but it
was only during last year that I discovered how much my grandfather knew
of the affair, and how well he had kept silence on the subject. I have
ransacked his journals, correspondence, &amp;c., in the interests of the
present work, and these have enabled me, I hope, to bring together much
not hitherto known, or, if known, forgotten.</p>

<p>As a humble follower of Lord Macaulay, I have also recognised the
value of pamphlets and chap-books, and have been able to obtain, with
some cost and trouble, nearly everything published on the palace
revolution during 1772 and 1773, in Germany, Denmark, and England. I have
also considered it my duty to consult every work at all connected with
the subject, and do not think that any one has been omitted.</p>

<p>Whether it has been in my power to prove the innocence of the Queen
of Denmark is a question for my readers to decide. I, however, take some
credit to myself for publishing for the first time the letter which she
wrote on her death-bed to her brother. This letter passed through the
hands of the late King of Hanover to the Duchess of Augustenburg, from
whom my copy is derived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, I have to return my hearty thanks to the many kind friends,
at home and abroad, who have aided me in my researches, or directed me
where to make them. I should be most ungrateful if I did not single out
<span class="smcap">Mr. Emanuel Deutsch</span>, of the British Museum,
who examined the MSS. department thoroughly on my behalf, even though he
drew a blank. The same, I regret to say, proved the case at the State
Paper Office, while the Foreign Office, where there was a prospect of
a successful find in the despatches of Messieurs Gunning and Keith,
remained hermetically closed to me. It was some compensation for this
refusal to find <span class="smcap">Sir Augustus Paget</span>, our envoy
at Copenhagen, at all times ready to assist me, and even to procure me
scarce books from the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is but fair
to add, that all the officials of our Foreign Office to whom I applied in
turn for admission to their archives, deplored their inability to break
through a rule which, for the interests of honest literary research,
would be far more honoured in the breach than in the observance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="p2">DEATH OF THE PRINCE OF WALES&mdash;HIS CHARACTER&mdash;HIS
EPITAPH&mdash;THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY&mdash;BIRTH OF CAROLINE
MATILDA&mdash;LORD BUTE&mdash;MELCOMBE'S DIARY&mdash;THE GREAT
NO-POPERY CRY&mdash;CHARACTER OF GEORGE III.&mdash;MAJORITY OF
THE PRINCE OF WALES&mdash;COURT CABALS&mdash;MISS CHUDLEIGH&mdash;HORACE,
PRINCE OF SCANDALIA.</p></blockquote>


<p>On a March evening, in 1751, the beau monde of
London was gently agitated by the news that Frederick,
Prince of Wales, had just expired, at his house
in Leicester Fields. He died somewhat suddenly,
and in the arms of one Desnoyers, a French dancing
master, who, having been called in to soothe the prince's
mind by playing the fiddle at his bedside, had the
honour of holding him in his arms during the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
struggle. Orpheus, we read, could charm savage beasts
by the sound of his lyre; but the violin, however
eloquently played, had no authority over tyrant Death.
The prince had received a blow in the side from a
cricket-ball some months previously, while playing at
that game on the lawn of Cliefden House. This had
formed an internal abscess, which eventually burst, and
the discharge suffocated him.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The prince's death created no great sensation. It
is notorious that he had long been on bad terms with
his royal father; but that is too common a thing in
German regnant houses to deserve comment: in such,
the rule <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">divide et impera</i> is carried out logically; that
is to say, the father tyrannises, and commands his son
to join the Opposition, in order, in any event, to keep
the power in the family, should the over-taut bow-string
snap.</p>

<p>Frederick, Prince of Wales, at an early age was instructed
in the noble art of hunting with the dogs and
howling with the wolves; and the historical searcher
comes across amusing instances of his pseudo liberalism.
One of the most remarkable, was his reply to
the City addresses on the birth of his eldest son, when
he had the audacity to say&mdash;doubtless, with his tongue
in his cheek&mdash;"My son, I hope, may come in time to
deserve the gratitude of a free people; and it shall be
my constant care to instruct him that true loyalty
can only be the result of liberty." I really cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
feel surprised at his father detesting the hypocrite so
thoroughly.</p>

<p>The fulness of pride which made George III. declare,
in his first speech after ascending the throne, that,
"born and educated in this country, I glory in the
name of Briton,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> had been fostered by his father from
a very early age. A curious instance of this will be
found in the following extract from a prologue to <cite>Cato</cite>,
which was put in the lad's mouth on January 4, 1749,
in a representation of that play by the royal family at
Leicester House. After making a tremendous panegyric
on liberty, the boy goes on to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Should this superior to my years be thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">Know&mdash;'tis the first great lesson I was taught.</div>
  <div class="i0">What! tho' a boy! it may with pride be said:</div>
  <div class="i0">A boy,&mdash;in England born,&mdash;in England bred;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where freedom well becomes the earliest state;</div>
  <div class="i0">For there the laws of liberty innate," &amp;c. &amp;c.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may fairly be assumed that this boast was produced
with such reiteration less through a feeling of
sincerity than a desire of instituting odorous comparisons
with the lad's grandpapa, who did not enjoy the
honour of being born a Briton. George II., who
with all his faults was no hypocrite, saw through this
amiable purpose, and detested his son the more.</p>

<p>Besides, George II., though a worthy little man in
some respects, was not remarkable for amiability of
temper; and though he professed to be devotedly attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to his wife&mdash;after her death&mdash;his affection during
her life was considerably suggested by that unconscious
dread which a stupid husband has of a wife who is not
only clever herself, but competent to gauge her husband's
stupidity.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Still, with all his grievances against
his son&mdash;and they were, doubtless, many&mdash;he ought to
have studied proprieties a little more, when he heard
of Prince Frederick's death; and that horrid "Fritz
ist todt," whispered in the ear of the Countess of Yarmouth,
displays an unforgiving spirit, hardly to be
reconciled with the generally generous temper of
George II.; for, like most peppery men, he was good
natured.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I have waded through all the authorities who have
left us any account of the prince, and the conclusion
arrived at is only a negative one. Lord Melcombe
may be put out of court at once, for he evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
wrote under the influence of that feeling of gratitude
which has been defined as a lively sense of favours to
come. Having been bubbled by the father, he did
not intend to spoil his game with the son,&mdash;especially
as that son was the future fountain of all honours. But
Frederick owed a great many of his bad qualities to
this Bubb Dodington, who in more than one respect
resembled the sillabub to which my Lord Chesterfield
compared him; for he was sweet, cloying, and left a
very unpleasant taste in the mouth. Surrounded by
flatterers and sycophants, Frederick had just sufficient
sense to see that he was being made a tool of; and he
learned the art himself to perfection. It has been
urged in his favour, that he patronised literature and
art; but if he obtained any credit on that account, it
was on the same principle as makes a one-eyed man
a king among the blind. He condescended to visit
<span class="smcap">Pope</span> at Twickenham; and, in return, the poet immortalised
him, by the delicate allusion conveyed in the
two lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"And if yet higher the proud list should end,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still, let me add, no follower but a friend."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, granted this merit, the remaining qualities that
make up the character of Frederick are of the most
negative type. He was a spendthrift: he borrowed
money unblushingly, careless as to where he obtained
it, and with the very faintest expectation of repaying
it. Though a father of seven children, he lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
open adultery with a lady, whose house in Pall Mall
had a secret communication with Carlton House. He
was pretty frequently in the habit of paying visits to
fortune-tellers; and would go in disguise to see the
bull-baiting at Hockley-in-the-Hole. Such is the residuum,
when we take away the prestige of princely
birth. Nor, had Frederick the good fortune to excite
a hearty detestation, except in the case of his father:
the people, generally, treated his death with the most
profound contempt. Two men were heard talking of
his decease in Leicester Fields:&mdash;"He has left a great
many small children." "Ay," replied the other; "and,
what is worse, they belong to our parish."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We may
safely say of him, in the courtly language of Sir W.
Wraxall: "As far as we are authorised, from these
premisses, to form a conclusion, his premature death
before he ascended the throne ought not to excite any
great national regret." But his memory will live forever,
in connection with the stinging epigram, in which
the Tory feeling toward the Hanoverian race is so
wonderfully depicted:&mdash;</p>

<p>And yet, bad though Frederick indubitably was, and
deficient in almost every quality that constitutes the
gentleman, we must not be too hard on him. The
manners of the age made him what he was; and he
would have been a wonderfully strong-minded man
had he resisted their influence. It may be a trite
remark, but I fancy that nothing strikes the historical
student more than the change of manners that has
taken place in so short a period. When I was a boy,
I remember being told by an old female relative that
she could perfectly well remember the coronation of
George III. In her presence, the reigns of George II.
and William IV. seemed to shake hands, and yet what
a chasm existed between them. The greater portion
of the eighteenth century was a Tophet; we need only
read Casanova's Memoirs to see what it was on the Continent;
but in England it strikes us even more offensively,
because here vice stalked forth with its brazen
brow uncovered. In France, on the other hand, there
was something Watteau-esque about it, and a slightly
redeeming grace. It is true that England had the
great blessing of an industrious middle class, among
which moral views and the honest customs of Puritanism
were maintained; but the aristocratic classes
were utterly corrupt. The Hanoverian dynasty introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
among other blessings, the <em>sauer-kraut</em> tone
of German pauper nobility; and its coarseness easily
found access among a people in whom every feeling of
decency had been destroyed by the fabulously shameless
comedians of the Restoration. The family life of
the two first Georges was one long offence against
propriety. Between the first George and his son the
feeling of hatred was so extreme, that, after the death
of the former, a document was found in his cabinet
containing the proposition and plan to seize the Prince
of Wales and ship him off to the colonies, where he
could be easily got rid of. When we remember, too,
the mistresses whom George I. brought in his train
from Hanover&mdash;the "Elephant," that enormous lump
of flesh, Sophie Freifrau von Kielmansegge, and the
"Maypole," her tall, thin rival, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gräfinn'">Gräfin</ins> Melusine
von Eberstein&mdash;we can easily understand the coarseness
which appears deep-rooted in English society far
into the eighteenth century. One thing we may say
in favour of this society, that no hypocrisy was
displayed. When Lady Dorchester, ex-mistress of
James II., once met in her old days, in George I.'s
ante-chamber, the Duchess of Portsmouth, ex-mistress
of Charles II., and Lady Orkney, ex-mistress of William
III., she exclaimed, loudly enough to be heard
by all persons, "Good God! who ever could have supposed
that we three (well, suppose I say Traviati, as
better suited to the age than the plump word employed
by her ladyship) should meet at this place?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
George II.'s sensible and virtuous wife strove in vain
to introduce a more decent tone into polite society;
and vice was still rampant far into the reign of her
well-meaning grandson.</p>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century, polite society added
to its other accomplishments that of the wildest gambling,
to which the South-Sea Bubble gave the impulse.
At White's, young gentlemen frequently lost in one
evening from &pound;5 to &pound;20,000; and at the Cocoa Tree,
one night, there was a single stake of &pound;180,000. The
unbounded betting mania among the bucks was often
displayed in the quaintest forms. Thus, for instance,
in 1756, Lords Rockingham and Oxford got up a race
between four geese and four turkeys from Norwich to
London. English "eccentricity," as the French would
call it, had the fullest scope at that time. Take, for
instance, Lord Baltimore, whom we find travelling on
the Continent, in 1769, with a harem of eight women,
on whom he tried all sorts of dietetic experiments. I
need only hint at the orgies held in Medmenham
Abbey, and the blasphemous travesties of the Hell-fire
Club, to which fifteen ladies of the highest rank considered
it an honour to belong.</p>

<p>At that time, the governing classes and the governed
had scarce anything in common but the air
they breathed, or an occasional street row. Fashionable
vice affected a publicity which imparts historic
value to the satirical descriptions which Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu has left us. She tells us, <em>inter alia</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
how, at Sir R. Walpole's seat, a bill was discussed, for
the purpose of omitting the "not" from the Ten Commandments.
Further on, we find a remark that both
sexes have so thoroughly recognised the inconveniences
of matrimony that even girls ridiculed it; and the title
of "rake" graces women no less than men. Or again,
we read that, now-a-days, it is not considered at all
improper to say publicly that the Maid of Honour,
Mrs. So-and-So, had got over her confinement, but
that Miss Whatshername has never thoroughly recovered
from her accouchement. With such a tone
prevailing in society, we can understand how Lord
Chesterfield could reply to the notorious Miss Chudleigh,
when she complained of having been falsely
accused of giving birth to twins, "For my part, I
never believe more than half of what people say."</p>

<p>Under the government of George III. matters became
no better. On the contrary, the fashionable
world seemed to take a pride in resenting by their
conduct the stupid domesticity of "Farmer George."
We come across lady topers, who could send the most
practised wine-bibbers under the table. Luxury,
which was enormously augmented by the return of the
Nabobs, who had shaken the pagoda-tree to some
effect, was displayed in the realisation of the most
wonderful caprices. Family and wedded honour was
trampled under foot, and the shamelessness of the
women attained incredible proportions. When one of
the most notorious demireps, Lady Worseley, ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
away with an officer, and the insulted husband sued
for a divorce, the lady, in the hope of saving her paramour's
purse, summoned as witnesses thirty-two young
noblemen and gentlemen, who had all been her lovers
with her husband's knowledge. Seven-and-twenty
really appeared in court, and one of them added, that
Sir Richard once took him up to the roof of the house
to show him his wife in her bath&mdash;a Venus Anadyomene.
On the day of this remarkable trial there
was an important motion in the House, and Lord
North was very anxious to secure the votes of his
whole party. Hence, when he did not see Sir Richard
in his place, and the reason for his absence was stated,
he exclaimed, "Oh! if all my cuckolds leave me in
the lurch, I shall surely be in a minority." An illustration
of this remark is afforded in the fact, that the
Bishop of Llandaff, when bringing in a bill to regulate
the Divorce Court, in 1777, stated, that since
George III.'s ascent of the throne, or during only sixteen
years, there had been more divorces than during
the whole previous history of England. The wives,
of course, merely followed the example of their husbands
in immorality, as is usually the case. How,
indeed, could any check be possible, when a British
minister, the Duke of Grafton, could dare to drive out
with his mistress, Nancy Parsons, one of the most notorious
Anonymas of the day, in the presence of the Court?</p>

<p>When fashionable vice was so openly and unblushingly
displayed, it could not fail but that the populace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the capital should now and then break out into
excesses of unbridled savagedom, as was more especially
the case in the notorious No-Popery riots of 1780.
Crimes increased to an extraordinary extent, not only
in number, but in brutality. Horrible murders were
every-day events, as a glance at the "Annual Register"
will afford sickening proof. Members of the aristocracy
committed the most aggravated murders. As an
instance, an Irish gentleman, after waylaying a rival
favoured by his mistress, offered him the choice between
death and awful mutilation, and, when the
latter was chosen, carried it out in such a way that
the mutilated man died. The boldness of the robbers
and highwaymen was unbounded. The Lord Chancellor
was robbed of the great seal of England, the
great Pitt of his plate, the Archbishop of Canterbury's
house was broken into, and the French mail stopped and
plundered in one of the busiest streets of the metropolis.
In vain did a justice, which rivalled crime in
barbarity, pass whole batches of death-sentences. In
one year (1766), two hundred and twenty-three persons
were cast for death at the Assizes, and duly
hanged. In 1786, one hundred and thirty-three were
sentenced to death at the Old Bailey alone. Very
significant signs of the age are the repeated instances
of idiotcy, insanity, and suicide. It was not at all
uncommon for a noble rake-hell,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who had drunk the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
cup of licentiousness to the dregs, to collect a number
of prostitutes for a final orgie, and blow out his brains,
either during or immediately after the Bacchanalian
revel.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of society at the time when
Augusta of Saxe-Coburg, Princess of Wales, was left
with seven young children, and another shortly expected.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
She was a young widow, only two-and-thirty
years of age, and had not a friend to depend on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
world. The king, her papa-in-law, cordially hated her,
and she had not even the consolation of regretting her
husband, for, though born a princess, she was a woman
after all, and had bitterly felt her late husband's open
profligacy with Lady Archibald Hamilton. Prince
George alone expressed any regret at his father's
death, and that was in a modified form. When he
was told of it, he turned pale, and laid his hand on his
breast. Ayscough said, "I am afraid, sir, you are not
well;" and the prince replied, "I feel something here,
just as I did when I saw the two workmen fall from
the scaffold at Kew."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Sturdy little King George very soon recovered from
the shock of his son's death, even if he felt it; for we
find that, on March 31, there was a great court at St.
James's, where the king appeared for the first time in
public since the death of the prince. On this occasion
Prince George, with his brothers, waited on his Majesty,
who, in the evening, paid a visit of condolence to his
daughter-in-law at Leicester House, which he followed
up by another visit on April 4, paying great attention
to her comforts, and ordering the first quarterly payment
of her income in advance.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This income was by
marriage settlement &pound;100,000 a year; but the princess
had formed a resolution to pay her husband's private
debts, and kept her word. Shortly after receiving this
scrap of comfort, the widow's family was enlarged; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the evening of June 13 the princess walked in Carlton
Gardens, supped, and went to bed very well; she was
taken ill about six o'clock on the following morning,
and at about eight was delivered of a princess&mdash;the
unfortunate <span class="smcap">Caroline Matilda</span>. "Both well," Melcombe
adds. Could he but have read the future, he
might have cried, "Better had she ne'er been born!"</p>

<p>The next few years passed over very tranquilly, to
all appearance; the princess devoted herself to the education
of her children, and listening to the advice of
the only man she thoroughly trusted&mdash;Lord Bute.
This nobleman, a poor Scotchman, had made the acquaintance
of Frederick several years before, and by
a diligent course of McSycophantism, had rendered
himself essential. Although he was the father of a
large family, his connection with the princess had the
worst possible interpretation put on it: and his unfortunate
propensity for playing the part of Lothario in
private theatricals, gave an awful handle to Wilkes,
Churchill, and the other miscreants, who made up for
the bluntness of the weapon they handled by the ferocity
of the blows they dealt. Even the elegant Horry put
an extra squeeze of gall into his standish when describing
the amours of the princess.</p>

<p>From Melcombe and Walpole we obtain a few glances
at the domestic life of the princess, which are worthy
of attention, as showing the sphere and the society in
which Caroline Matilda was educated. The mother, it
is quite certain, dearly loved her children, but had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
most disagreeable way of showing her love. She kept
a terribly tight rein over them, and imbued them with
her own prejudices and hatreds. Prince George's uncle,
"butcher George" of Cumberland, taking up a sabre
once and drawing it to amuse the child, the boy started
and turned pale. The prince felt a generous shock:
"What must they have told him about me?" he asked.
Very touching, too, is the story of the little Duke of
Gloucester (who in after years distinguished himself
with Lady Grosvenor). Seeing him silent and unhappy,
the princess sharply asked the cause of his silence: "I
am thinking," said the poor child. "Thinking, sir&mdash;of
what?" "I am thinking, if ever I have a son, I will
not make him so unhappy as you make me."</p>

<p>And yet this woman, with her cold repellent way,
adored her children, and would have readily laid down
her life for any one of them; but she forced back her
affection, lest the display of it might weaken her authority
over them. The examples of this maternal affection
are so frequent in Melcombe, that I may be pardoned
for putting together a few extracts which will
throw a little pleasing light on a most calumniated
woman:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Oct. 9, 1752.</i>&mdash;I received a letter from Mr. Cresset
that her royal highness would see me this morning. I
got to Kew at half-past eleven. I saw H.R.H. very soon;
she, the Ladies Augusta, Elizabeth, and I, went out
and we walked without sitting down for more than
three hours. We had much talk upon all manner of
private subjects, serious and ludicrous. Her behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
was open, friendly and unaffected. She commanded
me to dine and pass the evening with her. When we
came in we met Lady Middlesex, who had sent me
word she was to be there. We walked in the afternoon
till dark. As we came in, she said she had a petition
from the prince (of Wales) that we would play at
comet, of which he was very fond. The party was the
prince's&mdash;the Prince of Wales, Prince Edward; the
Ladies Augusta and Elizabeth, Lady Middlesex and
Charlotte Edwin, and myself."</p>

<p>"<i>Oct. 15, 1752.</i>&mdash;The princess having sent to desire
me to pass the day with her, I waited accordingly on
her between eleven and twelve. I saw her immediately;
H.R.H., the children, and Lady Charlotte
Edwin went walking till two, and then returned to
prayers, and from thence to dinner. As soon as dinner
was over, she sent for me, and we sat down to comet.
We rose from play about nine; the royal children retired,
and the princess called me to the farther end of
the room. She began by saying that she liked the
prince should, now and then, amuse himself at small
play, but that princes should never play deep, both for
the example, and because it did not become them to
win great sums."</p>

<p>I omit a long conversation in which the princess and
Melcombe discussed the ministry, and the king's conduct
towards her; after which the courtly scribe continues:
"I then took the liberty to ask her what she
thought the real disposition of the prince to be? She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
said that I knew him almost as well as she did; that
he was very honest, but she wished that he was a little
more forward, and less childish at his age; that she
hoped his preceptors would improve him. I begged
to know what methods they took, what they read to
him or made him read, and whether he showed a particular
inclination to any of the people about him. She
said she did not well know what they taught him, but,
to speak freely, she was afraid not much; that they
were in the country and followed their diversion, and
not much else. She said, Stone told her that when he
talked to the prince upon those subjects (the government
and constitution, the general course and manner
of business), he seemed to give a proper attention, and
made pertinent remarks. She repeated, he was a very
honest boy, that his chief passion seemed for his brother
Edward.... She said the prince seemed to have
a very tender regard for the memory of his father, and
that she encouraged it as much as she could; that when
they behaved wrongly, or idly (as children will do), to
any that belonged to the late prince, and who are now
about her, she always asked them how they thought
their father would have liked to see them behave so to
anybody that belonged to him, and whom they valued;
and that they ought to have the more kindness for
them, because they had lost their friend and protector,
who was theirs also; and she said she found that it
made a proper impression upon them."</p>

<p>"<i>Dec. 5, 1752.</i>&mdash;Lord Harcourt resigned being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
governor to the prince. He offered to do so, unless
Mr. Stone (placed as sub-governor by the ministers),
Mr. Scott, tutor in the late prince's time (but recommended
by Lord Bolingbroke), and Mr. Cresset, made
treasurer by the princess's recommendation, were removed.
The king desired him to consider of it; but
Lord Harcourt continuing in the same resolution, the
archbishop and lord chancellor were sent to him to
know the particulars of his complaints against those
gentlemen. He replied that the particulars were fit
only to be communicated to the king; and, accordingly,
he waited on his Majesty, which ended in his resignation.
The Bishop of Norwich sent in his resignation
by the same prelate and lord."</p>

<p>Sagacious Horace Walpole, who compressed so much
wit into a sheet of ordinary post, had entertained his
doubts about Lord Harcourt two years before: writing
to Sir H. Mann, on June 8, 1751, he says in his dry
way, "They have hooked in, too, poor Lord Harcourt,
and call him <em>Harcourt the wise</em>: (how Horace must
have grinned as he italicised the last word;) his wisdom
has already disgusted the young prince: 'Sir,
pray hold up your head,' 'Sir, for God's sake, turn
out your toes!' Such are Mentor's precepts."</p>

<p>The storm in a puddle about Stone created an enormous
sensation, and the old cry of "wooden shoes and
popery" rang through the land just as&mdash;well, just as
it does now-a-days, on any favourable occasion. The
story is a curious one, as told by Walpole, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Adolphus pooh-poohs it in a very lordly way in his
history of George III.</p>

<p>The young Prince of Wales, on the death of his
father, was placed by the king under the care of the
Earl of Harcourt as governor; of Dr. Hayter, Bishop
of Norwich, as preceptor; and of Mr. Stone and Mr.
Scott as sub-governor and sub-preceptor. The two
former were favourites of Lord Lincoln, the ministerial
nephew: Stone was the bosom-confidant of the
Duke of Newcastle: Scott, as well as the solicitor-general,
Murray, and Cresset, the favourite of the
princess, were disciples of Lord Bolingbroke, and his
bequest to the late prince. Stone, in general a cold,
mysterious man, of little plausibility, had always confined
his arts, his application, and probably his views,
to one or two great objects. The princess could answer
to all these lights; with her he soon ingratiated
himself deeply. Lord Harcourt was minute and strict
in trifles; and thinking that he discharged his trust
conscientiously, if on no account he neglected to make
the prince turn out his toes, he gave himself little
trouble to respect the princess, or to condescend to
the sub-governor. The bishop, thinking himself already
minister to the future king, expected dependence
from, and never once thought of depending upon, the
inferior governors. In the education of the two princes
he was sincerely honest and zealous, and soon grew to
thwart the princess whenever, as an indulgent, or perhaps
a little as an ambitious mother, (and this happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
but too frequently,) she was willing to relax
the application of her sons. These jars appeared soon
after the king's going to Hanover; and by the season
of his return they were ripe for his interposition.</p>

<p>With these disappointments, the king returned to
England, and arrived at St. James's, November 18th.
The princess appeared again in public, and the king
gave her the same honours and place as the queen
used to have. He was not in the same gracious
mood with others of the court. The calamity of
Lord Holderness, the secretary of state, was singular;
he was for some days in disgrace, for having played
at blindman's-buff in the summer at Tunbridge. To
Lord Harcourt the king said not a word. In the
beginning of December the chancellor and the archbishop
sent to Lord Harcourt that they would wait
on him by the king's command. He prevented them,
and went to the chancellor, who told him that they
had orders to hear his complaints. He replied, "They
were not proper to be told but to the king himself,"
which did not make it a little suspicious, that even the
princess was included in his disgusts. The first incident
that had directly amounted to a quarrel was the
Bishop of Norwich finding the Prince of Wales reading
Père d'Orleans's "Révolutions d'Angleterre," a book
professedly written by the direction, and even by the
communication, of James II., to justify his measures.
Stone at first peremptorily denied having seen that
book in thirty years, and offered to rest his whole justification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
upon the truth or falsehood of that accusation.
At last it was confessed that the prince had the
book, but it was qualified with Prince Edward's borrowing
it of his sister Augusta. Stone acted mildness,
and professed being willing to continue to act
with Lord Harcourt and the bishop; but the sore had
penetrated too deep, and they who had given the
wounds had aggravated them with harsh provocations.
The bishop was accused of having turned Scott one
day out of the prince's chamber by an imposition of
hands that had at least as much of the flesh as the
spirit in the force of the action. Cresset, the link of
the connection, had dealt out very ungracious epithets
both on the governor and preceptor; and Murray, by
an officious strain of strange impudence, had early in
the quarrel waited on the bishop, and informed him
that Mr. Stone ought to have more consideration in
the prince's family; and repeating the visit and opinion,
the bishop said, "He believed that Mr. Stone found all
proper regard, but that Lord Harcourt, the chief of
the trust, was generally present." Murray interrupted
him, and cried, "Lord Harcourt! pho! he is a cypher,
and must be a cypher, and was put in to be a cypher."
A notification, however understood before by the world,
that could not be very agreeable to the person destined
to a situation so insignificant! Accordingly, December
6th, Lord Harcourt had a private audience in the
king's closet, and resigned. The archbishop waited
on his Majesty, desiring to know if he would see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Bishop of Norwich, or accept his resignation from his
(the archbishop's) hands. The king chose the latter.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The poor princess was sadly perplexed by all this
pother, and told Melcombe that she knew nothing
of it, and could not conceive what they meant: but
she added, after profound reflection, "indeed, the
bishop was teaching them logic, which, as she was
told, was a very odd study for children of their age,
not to say of their condition." Perhaps, if Prince
George had paid more attention to the study, he would
not have behaved so illogically during the American
war. However, it all blew over again, ere long, and
we find Lord Melcombe able to record:</p>

<p>"<i>1753, February 8.</i>&mdash;I waited on the princess. She
began at once by saying she had good news to tell me;
that they were very happy in their family; that the
new bishop gave great satisfaction; that he seemed to
take great care and in a proper manner; and that the
children took to him and seemed mightily pleased.</p>

<p>"I stick (the princess is speaking) to the learning as
the chief point; you know how backward they were
when we were together, and I am sure you don't think
them much improved since. It may be that it is not
too late to acquire a competence, and that is what I
am most solicitous about; and if this man, by his
manner, should hit upon the means of giving them
that, I shall be mightily pleased. The Bishop of Norwich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was so confused, that one could never tell what
he meant, and the children were not at all pleased
with him. The stories about the history of the Père
d'Orleans were false; the only little dispute between
the bishop and Prince Edward, was about le Père
Péréfixe's history of Henry IV."</p>

<p>One more extract, and we return Lord Melcombe to
the limbo whence we drew him.</p>

<p>"<i>1753, November 17.</i>&mdash;The princess sent for me to
attend her between eight and nine o'clock. I went to
Leicester House, expecting a small company and a
little music, but found nobody but her royal highness.
She made me draw a stool and sit by the fireside.
Soon after came in the Prince of Wales and Prince
Edward, and then the Lady Augusta, all in undress,
and took their stools and sat round the fire with us.
We continued talking of familiar occurrences till
between seven and eleven, with the ease and unreservedness
and unconstraint, as if one had dropped into
a sister's house, that had a family, to pass the evening.
It is much to be wished that the princess conversed
familiarly with more people of a certain knowledge of
the world."</p>

<p>Bubb's closing remark may be truly endorsed.
Though Dr. Thomas, Bishop of Peterboro', the new
preceptor to the Prince of Wales, was a very excellent
man, and gave great satisfaction to the princess, from
the extraordinary care and proper manner manifested
in his conduct, and though the royal children loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
him, and were much pleased with his instruction,&mdash;for
all that I do not think him the right man in the right
place. Granted that the course of education became
of the most beneficial kind, and that the public were
fully satisfied that the prince, instead of being separated
from his remaining parent, should be especially under
her care, whilst he received his elementary initiation
into literature and politics, still, the result was a
faulty one, as a competent writer on the subject
allows.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the plan, however, of keeping the prince exempt
from the vices of the age, there was, perhaps, too
much and unnecessary strictness; as it went so far as
even to restrain him, with a few exceptions, from all
intercourse with the young nobility, confining his
knowledge of the world to books and the social circle
at Leicester House, which, though select and cheerful
as well as unrestrained, was not adapted to give that
manliness of character necessary for a monarch, and
might have been productive of much evil, had not the
prince's own natural resolution, since denominated
obstinacy, preserved him from acquiring that milkiness
of character which might have been expected.</p>

<p>Little did people think at the time how bitterly a
fair-haired cherub, then playing about the gardens of
Carlton House, would suffer from the want of knowledge
of the world in which her brother was being
brought up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>In this rambling chapter, the slightest allusion to
the family of Caroline Matilda must be forgiven, and
the following passage is solely inserted to prove the
thoughtfulness of the Princess of Wales for the poor,
and as a fair ground for assuming that <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">qualis mater,
talis filia</i>.</p>

<p>"Another instance of the attention paid by the Princess
Dowager to the encouragement of native industry,
and to the finding employment for females, was manifested
on the Princess Augusta's birthday, when she
herself, with all the princesses, appeared in curious
hats of fine thread needlework on book muslin, in
hopes of bringing them into fashion, as it would
employ a great number of poor girls, making useful
subjects of those who would otherwise be burdensome
to the public, or exposed to all the horrors of vice and
penury."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>I hesitated for a long time ere I made up my mind
to quote Walpole's account of the Prince of Wales
attaining his majority, for it contains many scandalous
insinuations against his mother, for which there is not
a particle of evidence. I have, however, decided on
giving it room, not only because it throws some light
on family affairs, but also because I have such faith in
the character of the princess that I believe it can defy
even worse attacks. Having a special object in view
in giving these details, which will not be visible for
some time hence, I throw down the glove to the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of scandal and her arch-priest, Horace Walpole,
and let them say their worst.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Wales attained the age prescribed
for his majority on June 4, by which the Regency
Bill remains only a dangerous precedent of power to
posterity&mdash;no longer so to us, for whose subjection it
was artfully, though, by the grace of God, vainly calculated.
This epoch, however, brought to light the
secrets of a court, where, hitherto, everything had
been transacted with mysterious decency. The princess
had conducted herself with great respect to the
king, with appearance of impartiality to ministers and
factions. If she was not cordial to the duke (of Cumberland),
or was averse to his friends, it had been
imputed less to any hatred adopted from her husband's
prejudices, than to jealousy of the government of her
son; if the world should choose to ascribe her attention
for him to maternal affection, they were at liberty; she
courted and watched him neither more nor less for
their conjectures. It now at last appeared that maternal
tenderness or ambition were not the sole passions
that engrossed her thoughts. It had already
been whispered that the assiduity of Lord Bute at
Leicester House, and his still more frequent attendance
in the gardens at Kew and Carlton House, were less
addressed to the Prince of Wales than to his mother.
The eagerness of the pages of the back-stairs to let
her know whenever Lord Bute arrived [and some
other symptoms] contributed to dispel the ideas that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
had been conceived of the rigour of her widowhood.
On the other hand, the favoured personage, naturally
ostentatious of his person, and of haughty carriage,
seemed by no means desirous of concealing his conquest.
His bows grew more theatric, his graces
contracted some meaning, and the beauty of his leg
was constantly displayed in the eyes of the poor captivated
princess. Indeed, the nice observers of the
court-thermometer, who often foresee a change of
weather before it actually happens, had long thought
that her royal highness was likely to choose younger
ministers than that formal piece of empty mystery,
Cresset, or the matron-like decorum of Sir George
Lee.... Her simple husband, when
he took up the character of the regent's gallantry, had
forced an air of intrigue even upon his wife. When
he affected to retire into gloomy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">allées</i> with Lady Middlesex,
he used to bid the princess walk with Lord
Bute. As soon as the prince was dead, they walked
more and more, in honour of his memory.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"The favour of Lord Bute was scarce sooner known
than the connections of Pitt and Legge with him.
The mystery of Pitt's breach with Fox was at once
unravelled&mdash;and a court secret of that nature was not
likely long to escape the penetration of Legge, who
wormed himself into every intrigue where his industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and subservience could recommend him&mdash;yet Legge
had not more application to power than Newcastle
jealousy of it. Such an entrenchment round the successor
alarmed him. It was determined in his little
council that the moment the Prince of Wales should
be of age, he should be taken from his mother; but
the secret evaporating, intimations by various channels
were conveyed to the Duke of Newcastle and to the
chancellor, how much the prince would resent any
such advice being given to the king, and that it would
not be easy to carry it into execution. The prince
lived shut up with his mother and Lord Bute, and
must have thrown them under some difficulties; their
connection was not easily reconcilable to the devotion
which they had infused into the prince; the princess
could not wish him always present, and yet dreaded
his being out of her sight. His brother Edward, who
received a thousand mortifications, was seldom suffered
to be with him; and Lady Augusta, now a woman,
was, to facilitate some privacy for the princess, dismissed
from supping with her mother, and sent back
to cheese-cakes, with her little sister Elizabeth, on
pretence that meat at night would fatten her too
much.</p>

<p>"The ministers, too apt to yield when in the right,
were now obstinate in the wrong place, and without
knowing how to draw the king out of the difficulty
into which they were pushing him, advised this extraordinary
step. On May 31st, Lord Waldegrave, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the last act of his office of governor, was sent with
letters of the same tenor to the prince and to his
mother, to acquaint them that the prince being now
of age, the king, who had ever shown the greatest
kindness and affection for him, had determined to give
him &pound;40,000 a-year, would settle an establishment for
him, of the particulars of which he should be informed,
and that his Majesty had ordered the apartments of
the late prince at Kensington, and of the queen at St.
James's, to be fitted up for him; that the king would
take Prince Edward too, and give him an allowance of
&pound;5,000 a-year.</p>

<p>"After a little consult in their small cabinet, both
prince and princess sent answers in writing, drawn up,
as was believed, by Legge, and so artfully worded,
that the supposition was probable. The prince described
himself as penetrated by the goodness of his
Majesty, and receiving with the greatest gratitude
what his Majesty, in his parental affection, was pleased
to settle on him; but he entreated his Majesty not to
divide him from his mother, which would be a most
sensible affliction to both. The answer of the princess
remarked, that she had observed, with the greatest satisfaction,
the impression which his Majesty's <em>consideration</em>
of the prince had made on him; and she expressed
much sensibility of all the king's kindness to her.
On the article of the separation, she said not a word."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of my studies, I have naturally gone
as deeply as I could into this question of the alleged
liaison between the princess and Lord Bute, and
believe I have traced it to its real source. On one
occasion, Miss Chudleigh appeared at a fancy ball,
dressed as Iphigenia waiting for the sacrifice, and so
décolletée that an eye-witness declared that she wished
to display her entrails to the sacrificing priest. The
princess mildly rebuked her for her licentiousness;
and the maid of honour flippantly replied, "Altesse,
vous savez, chacun à son bût." The retort was clever,
if impertinent, and spread like wildfire. Miss Chudleigh's
last good thing was quoted, and, from this
moment, I firmly believe, a hitherto floating charge
became anchored. That the couple intrigued, I am
willing to admit, but it was a political intrigue; a
woman, who has escaped from a profligate husband, to
whom she has borne nine children, does not so easily
place herself in another man's power. Bute was poor;
the princess was ambitious; they had the future king
of England in their hands, and meant to keep him.
Bute, mayhap, for ulterior purposes of his own, but
the mother most certainly, because she did not believe
her son capable of walking alone. Up to the
day of her death, she held unbounded sway over the
king; but, in no one instance, did she exert it to
benefit a favourite; while in the choice of her own
household, she was actuated solely by merit. Poor
woman! she had but few pleasures in this world; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
did her duty honestly, as she thought, and most certainly
set an example to mothers by the way in which she
brought up her children. The only reward she has
received from posterity has been at the most a flippant
sneer at her narrow-mindedness; but too often a hasty
condemnation as a widow who sought consolation in
the arms of her husband's friend.</p>

<p>Politest of epistolary Horaces, of the many sins you
have to answer for, the worst is surely your deliberate
attempt to blacken the character of an unoffending
woman, who tried to do her duty according to her
lights, and to whose fostering care we at any rate
owed one George, who stands out as a shining and
burning example among the four who bore the name.</p>

<p class="p1">MARRIAGE OF CAROLINE MATILDA.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is not possible to give any detailed account of the
youth of Caroline Matilda, for young princesses are not
brought much into evidence. Any one, for instance,
who desired to trace the life of the Princess Helena
from her birth to the present day, would necessarily
be but a small-beer chronicler; how much more is
this true in the case of Caroline Matilda; for George III.,
through a mistaken feeling of brotherly piety, destroyed
every scrap of paper that bore her handwriting. Hence,
I will not weary my readers by dull quotations from
the newspapers as to the appearances in public of the
princess, but leave them to the pleasing belief that the
first fifteen years of her life glided placidly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the results of her mother's careful training, we
fortunately possess fuller evidence, in an unpretending
work called "Memoirs of an Unfortunate Queen."
The authenticity of this book has been contested, because
it was published anonymously;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but after careful
examination and comparison, I am disposed to accept
it in evidence. The details connected with the palace
revolution, reveal an intimate knowledge of the facts,
which only a constant attendant on the Queen could
possess. At first, I was inclined to believe that my
grandfather was the author, but I find no proof to
that effect among his papers. That the book should
be published anonymously, adds, in this instance, to
its authenticity. George III. had a horror of the
facts connected with his sister being published, and
would have visited with his severest displeasure any
courtier guilty of such an offence. Hence, though the
author thought it his duty to vindicate the honour of
a beloved mistress, he did not consider that her cause
would be served by a self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>From her tenderest years, Caroline Matilda displayed
the most endearing vivaciousness, and a sweetness
of temper that could not fail to engage the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
affections of her attendants. When she attained the
age of discernment, her heart and her mind became
susceptible of the most generous sentiments. Her
person was graceful; her manners elegant; her voice
sweet and melodious, and her countenance most prepossessing.
The author of "Northern Courts," no
friend of the Queen generally, cannot refrain from
expressing his admiration of her beauty when he first
saw her. "Her complexion was uncommonly fine;
she might, without flattery, have been termed the
fairest of the fair. Her hair was very light flaxen,
almost as white as silver, and of luxurious growth;
her eyes were light blue, clear, large and expressive;
her lips, particularly the under lip, full and pouting;
her teeth white and regular." Her disposition was
most amiable; and several indigent families at Kew,
where this charming princess was not so much restrained
by the etiquette of a Court as in London,
often experienced her beneficence and liberality, and
frequently obtained considerable relief from her privy
purse.</p>

<p>Her education was a remarkable one for the times:
she spoke German, French, and Italian, fluently; and
her knowledge of English literature was very extensive.
Her diction was pure, and her elocution graceful.
She could, with facility, repeat the most admired
passages of our dramatic poets; and often rehearsed,
with great judgment and propriety, whole scenes of
Shakespeare's most admired plays. She performed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the pianoforte, and had a marked taste for music. She
also danced very gracefully.</p>

<p>Such innocence, beauty and grace, made a marked
impression on the English; and indeed the whole of
the king's brothers and sisters were popular. Mr.
Wraxall, of Bristol, writing to his son in 1775, to
condole with him on the death of his royal mistress,
may be regarded as expressing the general opinion,
when he says: "I have the most lively sense of what
the queen was only a few months before her marriage,
when her majesticness of person and the apparent
courtesy of her address, made very favourable impressions
on me; and I can fully acquiesce, notwithstanding
an obscurity in history, that on her own account
she was truly amiable and much worthy to be lamented."
We find in this passage a sympathy with the misfortunes
of Caroline Matilda, and regret for her premature
death, tempered by a doubt as to her purity, which
was aroused, as we shall see hereafter, by her brother's
ill-judged reticence on her behalf.</p>

<p>As a proof of the pretty, easy style of the princess's
correspondence, room must be made here for four of
her letters which have been preserved, and which are
written in the happy confidence of childhood. The
dates are not given, but they are evidently anterior to
the report of her marriage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Towards the close of 1764, the Danish ministry
opened negotiations to obtain for Prince Christian the
hand of his cousin, Caroline Matilda. In his speech
from the throne, on January 10, 1765, George III.
informed the nation:</p>

<p>"I have now the satisfaction to inform you that I
have agreed with my good brother, the King of Denmark,
to cement the union which has long subsisted
between the two crowns by the marriage of the Prince
Royal of Denmark with my sister the Princess Caroline
Matilda, which is to be solemnized as soon as their
respective ages will admit."</p>

<p>To which his Majesty's faithful Commons replied,
that the alliance was most pleasing to them, as it must
tend to cement and strengthen the ancient alliance
between the crowns of Great Britain and Denmark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and <em>thereby add security to the Protestant religion</em>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The announcement of the marriage was soon followed
by the public appearance of the princess at court, as
we find that on January 18 she opened the ball given
at St. James's in honour of her Majesty's birthday,
with the Duke of York.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the princess entertained any
pleasing sensations about the alliance she was about to
form. She was probably too young to have any personal
feelings as regarded her bridegroom elect, and
doubtless the sorrow she experienced arose from the
thought of the entire separation from her family. The
ladies in attendance on her observed that, after this
alliance was declared, she became pensive, reserved,
and disquieted, though always gracious, without taking
upon herself more state, or requiring more homage
from the persons admitted into her presence. A conversation
with one of her relations throws some light
on the nature of her feelings. As she had never been
farther from the metropolis than Windsor, before she
went abroad to be "sacrificed on the altar of inauspicious
Hymen," she said once to her aunt, the Princess
Amelia, previous to the departure of the latter for
Bath, "I wish most heartily that I could obtain permission
to accompany you, as nothing would give me
more pleasure and satisfaction than to travel in my
native country: but this indulgence I cannot expect,
since princesses of the blood royal, like cockneys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
seldom go beyond the bills of mortality." To which
her Royal Highness replied, "I should think myself
very happy were this exception to be made in my
favour: but I dare say it will not be long before you
see more of England, and some foreign country into
the bargain." "I guess what you mean," replied the
Princess Caroline, "but perhaps it would be more
happy for me to remain as I am, than to go so far for
a prince I never saw. To be or not to be? that is the
question." The same feeling, though in more guarded
language, is expressed in the following letter:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="p5"><i>To H.R.H. the Princess Mary of Hesse Cassel.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam and good Aunt</span>,</p>

<p>I give your Royal Highness my most sincere thanks
for your congratulation upon my approaching marriage:
but really I do not know whether we are not
rather objects of pity than envy, when we are politically
matched with princes whom we never saw, and
may not, perhaps, find in us those charms which, if
even real, are too often eclipsed by the beauties of a
court set off with national partiality. I am sensible
of the honour his Majesty of Denmark has done me,
by singling me out from among so many amiable princesses,
perhaps more worthy of his choice, but my
youth and inexperience make me apprehensive of not
fitting the highest station of a kingdom according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the expectations of subjects, who seldom think themselves
obliged to us for the little good we do, and always
impute to us part of their grievances. However,
as my scruples will not in the least avail, I shall do
my best to please the king and to conciliate the affections
of his subjects. I am glad that this alliance is
an additional affinity to your Royal Highness, of
whom I am</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The death of Frederick V. of Denmark and accession
of Christian VII. on January 14, 1766, offered
no impediment to the marriage; on the contrary, it
appears as if it were solemnized, in consequence,
earlier than had been originally intended. The general
opinion of the British public was favourable to the
marriage, which was preceded by one between a sister
of Christian VII. and the prince royal of Sweden.
The double marriage appeared to cement the Protestant
interest, and thus counterpoise the close union
of the House of Bourbon. Moreover, it was hoped
that the French influence, which had so long prevailed
at Copenhagen, would be abolished in favour of the
Anglo-Prussian system, and&mdash;to quote the words of
the "Annual Register"&mdash;"it is not to be doubted, but
the amiable princess whom his Danish Majesty is
about to espouse, will contribute greatly to increase
these good dispositions, as well as the harmony and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
friendship which still subsists between our court and
nation and those of Denmark."</p>

<p>On June 3, 1766, a message from the crown was
delivered to the House, asking a portion for the Princess
Caroline upon her marriage with the King of Denmark.
Dyson, in opposition to the ministers, offered
a precedent against taking the message into consideration,
except in committee or the next day,&mdash;a strange
disrespect, unless it had been concerted with the
king. This occasioned a long debate, in which Conway
greatly distinguished himself by his spirit and abilities;
and Dyson's motion was rejected by 118 to 35. Next
came a message for a settlement on the princess.
Augustus Hervey proposed to amend the address, and
to promise to take it into immediate consideration.
This, too, was outvoted; and Charles Townshend
spoke finely on the occasion with great encomiums on
the Duke of Grafton and Conway.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The portion
actually voted was &pound;100,000.</p>

<p>At half-past seven in the evening of Oct. 1, 1766,
H.R.H. Caroline Matilda was married at the Chapel
Royal of St. James. H.R.H. the Duke of York was
proxy for the King of Denmark, and the ceremony was
performed by his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Next morning, at a quarter past six, her Majesty set
out from Carlton House for Harwich, accompanied by
H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester, the Honourable Lady
Mary Boothby, and Count von Bothmar, her Majesty's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Vice-Chamberlain and late Danish Envoy in England,
in a train of three coaches, escorted by parties of light
horse, horse grenadiers, and life-guards, and a numerous
train of domestics and attendants. The parting between
the Queen of Denmark and H.R.H. the Princess
of Wales was extremely tender; the young queen was
observed on getting into her coach to shed tears, which
greatly affected the populace assembled in Pall Mall
to witness her departure.</p>

<p>Her Majesty arrived at Harwich at a quarter to four
on the 2nd October, where Admiral Keppel was awaiting
her with the royal yacht. During the whole journey
from London she was seen to be buried in deep thought,
and to gaze frequently and sadly at a talisman given
her by her affectionate mother&mdash;it was a ring, with the
inscription "Bring me happiness." Could she have had
a foreboding of the fearful fate that awaited her at Copenhagen?
Nature, too, appeared to oppose her departure,
for the wind blew so heavily that it was not
thought advisable for the queen to embark that night.
She lay at the house of Mr. Davis, collector of customs,
and spent the evening in writing the following letter
to her favourite brother, the Duke of York:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir and dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just time enough to write you these few lines
from England. If patriotism consists in the love of
our country, what I feel now at the sight of that element
which, in a few hours, shall convey me far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
this happy land, gives me a just claim to that virtue.
Perhaps you men, who boast of more fortitude, call
this sensibility weakness, as you would be ashamed to
play the woman on such an occasion; but, in wishing
you all the temporal felicity this life can afford, I confess
all the philosophy I am mistress of cannot hinder
me from concluding, with tears in my eyes,</p>

<p class="center">Sir, and dear brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your most affectionate sister,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the next morning, October 3, her Majesty embarked
at half-past eleven, and her sobbing heart found
at least some relief and comfort in a flood of tears. Of
this circumstance an eye-witness remarks: "The tears
of her Majesty, on parting from the dear country in
which she drew her first breath, might have inspired in
those who beheld them gloomy forebodings as to the
issue of the voyage she was about to undertake." In
another account we read how the queen was dressed in
bloom colour with white flowers. Wherever she passed,
the earnest wishes of the people were for her health,
and praying to God to preserve her from the perils of
the sea. A gentle melancholy at times seemed to affect
her on account of leaving her family and the place of
her birth; but, upon the whole, she carried an air of
serenity and majesty which exceedingly moved every
one that beheld her. As Mrs. Gillespie Smyth justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
remarks,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "how irresistibly do these details of the contemporary
chronicler, in the quaint language of the
times&mdash;the bloom-coloured dress and so on, suggest to
those acquainted with the sad sequel the idea of an unconscious
victim proceeding to her doom!"</p>

<p>The very sea seemed reluctant to surrender its lovely
burden, for it was not till the 9th, a little before nine
o'clock in the morning, that the queen safely landed at
Rotterdam. Thence she set out for Utrecht, in the
Prince of Orange's yacht. The Prince of Orange, the
Prince and Princesses of Nassau Weilburg, and Prince
Louis of Brunswick, received her Majesty on her landing,
and conducted her to the apartments in the Admiralty
House, which the magistrates of Rotterdam
had fixed upon as the most convenient for her Majesty
to arrive at, and where she was pleased to accept the
compliments of the regency of that city. The Princess
of Weilburg accompanied the queen through the town
to her yacht, amidst the acclamations of the people,
where the Prince of Orange again received her Majesty,
and took leave.</p>

<p>Her Majesty travelled <i>viâ</i> Osnabrück, Lingen, and
Utrecht to Harburg, and, on October 18, reached Altona,
where she was welcomed by the viceroy of the
duchies, Baron von Dehn, in the name of her consort.
The joy with which she was received was almost indescribable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
The bridge prepared for her royal reception
was covered with scarlet cloth, on one side of which
were ranged the ladies, and on the other the men, and
at the end were two rows of young women, dressed
in white, who strewed flowers before her Majesty as
she approached. "The illuminations were inconceivable,"
the chronicler, lost for language, concludes.
On the 22nd she set out for Copenhagen with Baron
von Dehn.</p>

<p>In England the marriage was accompanied by the
usual loyal addresses, which require no special comment,
except in the case of that presented by the city
of London, in which Mr. Recorder alludes to the auspicious
marriage with that great "potentate" the King
of Denmark, which leads to the notion that Englishmen
must either have had a very poor opinion of their
own country, or else could afford to be generous when
referring to that tight little kingdom of Denmark. Another
remarkable fact for the verse-writing century is,
that I do not find a single epithalamium or flourish of
poetical trumpets in honour of the marriage. Even
loyal Mr. Whitehead, who earned his sack most honestly,
and neglected no opportunity to give his Pegasus
a canter, found no inspiration in the royal marriage.</p>

<p>At this point in Caroline Matilda's life I will leave
her for a while, in order to introduce the reader to the
other principal actors in the strange eventful drama of
her life. We have seen how she was transported at
once from the bosom of a happy private family to the
morally aid physically frozen regions of the north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Born after the early and sudden demise of her father,
this posthumous pledge of conjugal affection must have
grown closely to the widowed mother's heart, while at
the same time we can fully understand how genial
must have been the atmosphere in which the natural
talents and acquired accomplishments of the youngest
of a large and happy family were previously developed.
She left her home without the slightest acquaintance
with the external world, "as unprepared to encounter
its stern realities as some tender exotic, from her favourite
summer abode at Kew, would have been to
meet the blasts of the climate to which she was transplanted."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>On January 29, 1749, an heir to the united kingdoms
of Denmark and Norway, the equally united duchies
of Schleswig and Holstein, (with the exception of that
portion of the latter country which was still Russian,)
and to the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst,
first saw the light of the world in the person of the
future Christian VII. Great was the delight of the
royal parents at the birth of this son, because it prevented
the possibility of any dispute about the succession
on the death of the reigning monarch. In the
duchies and counties the agnatic line alone was able to
succeed, while in the two kingdoms the cognate line
was competent to ascend the throne. This requires a
few words of explanation, as the whole Schleswig-Holstein
embroglio is based on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1460, after the expiration of the Schauenburg
race, the estates of Schleswig-Holstein elected as their
prince the same Count Christian of Oldenburg, who
twelve years previously had been elected King of Denmark,
and bears in history the name of Christian I.
At this election, among other regulations, were two,
to the effect that, first, Schleswig should never be reunited
to Denmark, but that Schleswig and Holstein
"should remain eternally undivided and together;"
and, secondly, as regarded the succession, it was established
that, by virtue of the law of succession prevailing
in the German empire from the oldest times, in
Schleswig-Holstein only the male branch of the House
of Oldenburg should succeed by right of primogeniture.
The female line was thus excluded, while, on
the other hand, it was admitted to succession in Denmark.
In the event of the male line expiring, therefore,
the same thing would occur in respect to the
united kingdoms of Denmark as happened, in 1837,
with regard to the united kingdoms of Hanover and
Great Britain. In England the female line was capable
of succeeding to the throne, while in Hanover, by
virtue of the old imperial law, only the male branch
was admitted. When William IV. died, in 1837,
the nearest female collateral succeeded him in Queen
Victoria, while Hanover fell to the nearest male agnate,
the Duke of Cumberland.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick V. received from his subjects the honourable
surname of "the good," as did his grandson,
Frederick VI., after him. Judging from contemporary
records, he hardly earned the title, toward the
close of his reign at any rate. Queen Louisa, a
daughter of our George II., was literally adored for
her goodness of heart and beauty by all her subjects,
whether Danes, Norwegians, or Germans.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Hence
great pity was felt when the young prince lost this
tender mother in his third year, for she died in
1751.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The blow was so terrible to the king that he was
inconsolable. Sir C. Hanbury Williams, arriving
three weeks afterwards to deliver a letter of condolence
from King George II., still found the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
widower in tears; not only was court mourning ordered
for a year, but every public amusement in the whole
kingdom was prohibited for the same period. Notwithstanding
this order, when a few months had passed,
the easy and feeble nature of Frederick V. made him
forget the great loss he had sustained, and he looked
out for another queen.</p>

<p>Scarce six months of the twelve had elapsed, during
which his subjects were to mourn for him, when the
king cast off gloom and fond remembrance by marrying
the Princess Juliana Maria of Wolfenbüttel.
This princess, the youngest of six daughters, had been
educated so carefully as to enjoy the reputation of
being one of the most accomplished, princely daughters
of the time, while the fame of her beauty equalled
that of her other brilliant qualities. Her eldest and
second sisters were married respectively to Frederick
the Great, and Prince Augustus William, the heir
presumptive to the Prussian throne. But this step-mother
was less able to play the part of a true mother
to the bereaved royal children, because she was
the exact opposite of the departed queen in disposition.</p>

<p>According to the author of "Northern Courts,"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the new queen was a little more than kin and less than
kind. She hated the late queen's children, and, if she
had dared, would have sent them to follow their mother
to the grave. At an early age, in her father's petty
court, she was a great dabbler in political intrigues;
in her temper, she was sullen, cruel, and vindictive;
extremely penurious, forgetful of benefits, but never
failing to avenge an injury tenfold; above all, a most
profound dissembler, and able to wear a smile on her
face and show all manner of civilities to the person
most mortally hated, and whose destruction, at that
very moment, she might be planning.</p>

<p>After giving birth to a weak, deformed son, who
offered a striking contrast to Louisa's fair and white-haired
boy, there is a dark rumour that Juliana Maria
so far gave way to her fury as to attempt to remove
the future heir to the throne by poison. The story
is told with much circumstantiality in the "Northern
Courts," but we need not dwell on the painful details.
Suffice it for our purpose to say, that the
design was detected by Christian's faithful Norwegian
nurse, and the secret was revealed to the omnipotent
minister, Count Moltke. The affair, of course, reached
the king's ears, whose feelings, from this moment, revolted
against his guilty consort. Unfortunately, for
the sake of drowning his sorrow, he fell into habits of
intoxication, and the government entirely passed into
the hands of Count Moltke, who was generally known
in public by the ironical title of "King Moltke."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor does it appear that Juliana Maria gave up her
machinations. We have it on the highest authority<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
that she strove by gold and promises to seduce the
attendants of the child. Excursions were frequently
made on the lake behind the castle of Fredensborg,
to amuse the royal family. Christian, during one of
these excursions, was more restless and troublesome
than usual; entreaties and reproaches could not make
him be quiet. A chamberlain of the name of Brockdorf,
who was somewhat rough and unpolished in his
actions, threatened to throw the young prince into the
water if he would not be quiet; he really seized him
by the arm, and was so awkward and unlucky as to
give the prince such a push that he fell overboard, but
was immediately saved. He never forgot this moment,
and imputed the accident to a design on his life, made
by his step-mother, that she might raise Prince Frederick
to the throne. This suspicion grew up with
him, and no one was ever able to eradicate it.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Far be it from my wish to condemn the queen
dowager on this evidence. I prefer to employ it in
confirmation of the generally-expressed opinion that
she detested her step-children, and would have gladly
secured the throne for her own son. In any case, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is quite certain that, from the outset, Christian's education
was entrusted to improper hands. After all, though,
can we blame a mother because she anxiously interests
herself in the welfare of her own son? It is probable
that many of the stories connected with Juliana
Maria rest on <em>ex post facto</em> evidence; and though I adhere
to my opinion that she behaved with unnecessary
cruelty to Caroline Matilda when she held the latter
in her power, I do not believe that the stories which I
have been compelled to bring forward against her are
more than the natural exaggerations of party spirit.
For instance, in the case of the accident in the water,
how easily might that have occurred without the
slightest premeditation?</p>

<p>On attaining his sixth birthday, on March 31, 1755,
the prince was given his own household,&mdash;Privy Councillor
von Berkentin being appointed principal governor.
He was an old gentleman fond of peace and comfort in
the highest degree, and hence the education of the
prince was left entirely to Chamberlain Detlev von
Reventlow, who was appointed his tutor. This gentleman,
unfortunately, however, was an ignorant, arrogant,
ambitious, and coarse man, and treated the
young and promising prince with great harshness.
He often punished his royal pupil, for trifling offences,
so inhumanly, that the foam gathered on the delicate
lad's lips; and when the poor little fellow, writhing
with pain, sought help and mercy from the wife of his
torturer, he was no better treated by her. Reventlow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
used to order very elegant clothes for his pupil from
Paris; he presided at his toilet, and decided on his
shoes and lace; then the austere Mentor would lead
him into the court circle, saying, "I will go and show
my doll."</p>

<p>If we may regard it as fortunate that the prince,
under such circumstances, did not lose all inclination
for learning, or sink into a state of imbecility, the
results of this treatment were not the less injurious to
him. He was endowed with wit and sense, but these
qualities soon assumed a dangerous satirical tendency,
from his hearing the incessant sarcastic observations
which his tutor made about nearly everybody else.
Reventlow had a habit of speaking most irreverently
of the clergy and the Bible, though, at the same time,
he was very strict about the prince regularly attending
service, and when he came out of church, made him
repeat the entire argument of the sermon. Afterwards,
Christian stated that Sunday was his greatest
day of torment; and he avenged himself, in his governor's
absence, by giving extremely buffoon parodies of
some of the sermons he heard in church. Reventlow
had an amiable way of pinching him in church when
his attention appeared to flag.</p>

<p>As an instance of Christian's sarcasm, take the following
anecdotes. In one of Frederick V.'s dipsomaniac
fits, he made Count Moltke a present of the
magnificent palace of Hirschholm and all its costly
furniture. The crown prince, hearing of this lavish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
act, went to his study, and taking in his hand a plan
of the palace, carried it to Count Moltke, saying:
"Content yourself with this, I beseech your excellency;
and believe me, unless you possess the crown,
Hirschholm shall never be yours." The second incident
displays even greater sarcasm. On another
occasion, the king desired Prince Christian to fill the
glasses for himself and the count. The prince coloured,
and hesitated. The king repeated his commands, telling
him to fill for himself also; upon which, the spirited
youth just filled to the brim the glass that stood before
the count, the king's glass only half full, and into his
own he poured scarce any wine. "Heyday! what do
you mean by this, Christian?" said the king. "I
mean, sire," he said, "to denote hereby our relative
consequence in the state. Count Moltke, being king
and minister, I filled the glass commensurate with his
authority; you, my father, being the next person in
the state to the count, I half-filled your glass; as for
myself, being of no consequence whatever, I took no
wine."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>"His Royal Highness," as the young prince was
now addressed, received as his instructor Nielsen, ex-governor
of the pages. Bernstorff had tried to acquire
the German poet Gellert as tutor for the prince, but to
the regret of all right-minded Danes, he declined the
offer, and the man then selected for the post was very
little fitted to educate a future autocrat. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to the instructions drawn up for his guidance, Nielsen
was ordered to strive to gain his pupil's affection, so
that the latter might find pleasure in his teacher's
company. He was to begin with teaching him the
Christian religion, and thus arouse in the prince a
resolution to lead a virtuous course of life. The
teacher must not strive to attain this object by making
the prince learn a number of texts by heart, but by
frequent repetition of those rules of life on which salvation
and the fulfilment of Christian duties depend.
The teacher must be equally careful that the prince
should be accustomed from his youth up to pray
morning and evening, and display love, obedience, and
confidence toward the Supreme Being. In all these
matters the teacher would offer his pupil a good
example through the propriety of his own words and
conduct.</p>

<p>After this had been effected, the prince would be
taught to read and understand a book, and to write a
legible hand. The teacher would also try to give him
a knowledge of Latin, but before all the prince must
learn the history of the neighbouring states. The
prince would make himself acquainted with the topography
of the countries from the latest maps, as well
as with the genealogy and family trees of the princes,
especially of his own ancestors, whose glorious exploits
must be frequently recited to the prince, in order to
encourage him in taking their virtuous and noble lives
for his model. All this must be brought before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
young prince in amusing narratives, so that he might
acquire a taste for them. In all other matters connected
with the prince's education, however, the teacher
must consult with the tutor, Herr von Reventlow.</p>

<p>These general instructions certainly contained much
that was excellent, but of what avail are the best
regulations, if they are not followed? Nielsen troubled
himself but little about gaining his royal pupil's affection,
and only too willingly had recourse to Reventlow's
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">argumentum baculinum</i>. The prince's education
was neglected: he learned but little history and philosophy,
and was left in complete ignorance of the
principles of political economy. He was actually
taught the history of Denmark from a French work
written by Mallet. One step in the right direction,
however, was that the Danish language, spoken in both
kingdoms, was not so neglected as it had formerly
been, for the whole <em>entourage</em> of the prince, with the
exception of the foreign teachers, were prohibited from
employing any other language than Danish in conversing
with Christian;&mdash;a rule which was carried
out as well upon Prince Frederick's birth, and was
also pursued in the case of his young sister, who was
afterwards Duchess of Augustenburg.</p>

<p>In 1760 a change for the better was effected, by
Reverdil being appointed to instruct the prince in the
French language and literature. This most upright
Vaudois, of whom even carping Voltaire was obliged to
say, "On peut avoir autant d'esprit que Reverdil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
mais pas davantage," left behind him a very valuable
MS. relating to Christian VII. and his court, which
was published in 1858,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and throws an entirely
different light on affairs. From him we have the
following account of Christian when twelve years of
age.</p>

<p>"The prince had a charming face: happy sallies of his
were quoted: in his education, he succeeded in all the
exercises for which he felt an interest; he spoke very
pleasantly, and even elegantly, the three languages
necessary at his court:&mdash;Danish, German, and French:
and he was already a brilliant dancer. No one, in a
word, even among his familiars, saw in him aught but
an amiable lad, from whom great things might be expected,
when age had slightly calmed his first impetuosity."
Still, in a very few days Reverdil perceived
that if the prince was superior to the common herd
through his graces and talents, he was not the less
extraordinary in his faults. One of the most curious
traits about the prince was to desire to become strong,
vigorous, and "hard," and he imagined that he was
much more favoured by nature in this respect than he
really was. Reverdil has no doubt but that this was
a sign of incipient insanity. Christian looked at his
hands, and felt his stomach to discover whether he was
advancing, that is to say, whether he was progressing
toward a state of perfection which he vaguely imagined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and about which his ideas often varied. The following
explanation Christian himself gave Reverdil some
twelve years later, at the period when his mind was
completely deranged.</p>

<p>The king remembered that, at the age of five years,
he was taken to an Italian play, and that, struck by
the stature and dress of the actors, he had regarded
them as beings of a superior species, whom he would
some day come to resemble, after undergoing numerous
trials and metamorphoses. From that time he always
desired to advance: but after a while supreme perfection
appeared to him to be the possession of a perfectly
hard body,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a quality which was connected in his
mind with the idea of strength, at the time when
Reverdil entered on his duties: for, with strength, he
could have resisted his governor, while with insensibility
he could have been pinched and beaten, without
feeling pain. When in this state of mind, the unhappy
boy set but slight value on his princely rank. He
envied the lot of the shepherds whom he saw in the
country, or the gamins in the streets. He frequently
imagined that he had been changed at nurse by Frau
von Schmettau, or at least that he should some day
escape the misfortune of reigning.</p>

<p>The utter want of tact which Reventlow displayed
in the treatment of his princely pupil, would be incredible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
if we did not have it on the authority of
Reverdil. When the governor was more annoyed than
usual, he would shout through the apartments for a
rod, for though its use had almost entirely ceased, the
threat of it lasted some time longer. These wretched
scenes were public, for they could be heard from the
palace yard, and were frequently continued outside the
school-room. The crowd, who came to worship the
rising sun, had the object of their homage presented
to them in the shape of a very handsome and graceful
boy with tear-swollen eyes, who tried to read in his
tyrant's face whom he should address. When the circle
was ended, chosen courtiers were invited to dinner.
The Mentor seized on the conversation, or at times
continued his questioning and rough treatment. The
lad was thus exposed before his own servants, and grew
familiarised with shame.</p>

<p>We can quite understand how the poor little fellow
said once to Reverdil, "The amusements of yesterday
considerably wearied my Royal Highness," for never
did a child of such illustrious rank enjoy his privileges
so little. One day, when Count Moltke gave him a
party, the governor did not allow him to be informed
of it. He feared lest the thought of the pleasure might
distract the prince's mind during lessons. The day
was a stormy one; the prince was scolded and beaten,
and cried up to the hour for the ball. All at once he
was led away, without being told whither. Fear
seized on him, and was connected in his brain with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
his secret manias: he imagined that he was being taken
to prison. The military honours paid him at the
door, the beating of the drum, the guards round his
carriage, everything that could recall his courage, only
terrified him; his mind was disturbed for the whole
night, he took no pleasure in dancing, and several years
after he reminded Reverdil of the affair with positive
terror.</p>

<p>The prince also made some progress in the arts. He
played the piano, and drew and danced a minuet with
admirable grace. Proper attention was also paid to his
military education, according to the custom of the day,
for, in 1755, or when he was seven years old, the prince
commanded a regiment at a review.</p>

<p>On attaining his twelfth year, Christian passed an
examination in the presence of the ministers of state,
the Bishop of Copenhagen, one of the chaplains, and
the attorney-general. In their presence the prince answered
questions, and discharged his memory of everything
that blows had accumulated in it. Every one
went away satisfied: the governor was overwhelmed
with praise, the witnesses dined at court, and fancied
the prince a prodigy. Christian himself was rewarded
by three days' holiday.</p>

<p>During the next few years Reverdil suffered a martyrdom,
for he saw that incessant efforts were made to
destroy his pupil's faculties, while the latter learned
nothing that appertained to his duties as sovereign.
Not only was Christian taught nothing concerning the
relations of Denmark with foreign countries, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mode of government employed in his own, but he never
even learned to manage his own expenses. When he
ascended the throne, he had never spent a ducat for
himself. Some years previously the king had given
him a country seat: the prince had not appointed a
gardener or porter of his own, or planted a single tree.
Reventlow managed everything, and spoke very justly
about "my melons and my peaches."</p>

<p>On March 31, 1765, Christian, after due preparation
by the orthodox Bishop Harboe, publicly made his
confession of faith at confirmation, and his behaviour
and sensible answers produced a very good impression.
But for all that he was still treated as a boy, even after
he had been declared of age by the Emperor of Germany
as Duke of Holstein.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This was the more inexcusable, because, by the <i>Lex
Regia</i> of Denmark the heir-apparent was declared competent
to reign when he attained his fourteenth year;
and, moreover, the king's failing health promised the
latter no lengthened life. In 1757 or 1758 Frederick
V. had suffered an attack of pleurisy, the natural consequence
of his excesses. The ministers consulted
clever physicians on his behalf, under an assumed
name. The reply was, that if the convalescent did not
change his mode of life, he ran a risk of a relapse, and
a dropsy would end his days. The council of state
laid this consultation before the king, who was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
affected by it, and regretted that he had allowed his
passion to gain such a mastery over him. But those
who were acquainted with the palace secrets foresaw
that the monarch would soon fall a victim to his intemperance,
and leave the throne to his son. In December,
1765, the dropsy made such progress that the
king's death appeared close at hand. His intellectual
faculties were also attacked; the monarch, though naturally
kind and affectionate, became difficult and violent.
He constantly talked about augmenting his army,
and placing it on the Prussian footing.</p>

<p>It is very probable that the insult offered the crown
prince by keeping him aloof from the government
emanated from the king's favourite, Count Adam Gottlob
von Moltke, who would not let the reins of government
out of his hands. On the other hand, the premier
had no objection to the proposed marriage with an
English princess, and the affair was taken in hand by
Count Bernstorff. The English envoy thus reported to
his court about the prince: "He has a pleasant and masculine
appearance, a distinguished and attractive form,
and graciousness and affability combined with dignity."
In July, 1765, the portrait of Caroline Matilda arrived
in Copenhagen from London, and was hung up over
the writing-table of the crown prince. He gazed at it
with pleasure, and evinced his satisfaction "by expressions
of delight."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>On the night of January 13, 1766, King Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
V. died. It is reported that about an hour before his
death he called the prince royal to his bedside, and,
taking him by the hand, said, "My dear son, you will
soon be king of a flourishing people; but remember,
that to be a great monarch it is absolutely necessary
to be a good man. Have justice and mercy, therefore,
constantly before your eyes; and, above all things, reflect
that you were born for the welfare of your country,
and not your country created for your mere emolument.
In short, keep to the golden rule of doing as
you would be done by; and whenever you issue an
order as a sovereign, examine how far you would be
willing to obey such an order were you a subject yourself."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
A more than ordinary flourish of trumpets was
raised in the English papers on the death of this monarch:
the following may serve as a sample:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There never appeared in any kingdom more deep
and affecting sorrow for the loss of a sovereign than
now in Denmark on the death of their late king: his
reign was a perfect model for all future reigns; his
lenity was the more commendable, as the form of government
gave him absolute power: he preferred the
happiness of his subjects to all the considerations which
ambition and vainglory could inspire: he was quick to
reward, and slow to punish: his bounties were royal,
and his chastisements paternal: in private life he ever
appeared the true friend, the dutiful son, the tender
husband, the good father, and the generous master."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The real truth of matters was, that during the last
years of Frederick's reign, the foreign envoys had been
by turns the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> rulers of Denmark. In March,
1759, France signed a convention, by which she assured
Denmark an annual subsidy of 2,000,000 francs. These
subsidies were not paid with due punctuality during the
Seven Years' War, and hence, in the year 1763, there
were arrears amounting to 2,388,897 thalers, or about
10,400,000 livres. Gleichen, who was appointed Danish
envoy to France in that year, received instructions to
effect the settlement of the arrears, and we find, from
his "Notices Biographiques," that he succeeded in procuring
the Danish court six millions of the arrears.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
These subsidies were paid Denmark to raise a fleet
with which to protect the Danish ships conveying munitions
of war to France; but Denmark was a heavy
loser by the bargain, for the expenses not only greatly
exceeded the receipts, but the affair also rendered England
very dissatisfied.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>According as the representatives of foreign courts had
at their command more diplomatic brutality, finesse, or
money, the power was in turn with the Russian or
French envoy, at times with the English, and they
guided or ordered the Danish ministers, and through
them the king. How matters went on is seen from
the fact that about fourteen hundred French adventurers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
mostly of the lowest stamp, were appointed in the
Danish civil and military service. The French envoy
had recommended, among other excellent Frenchmen,
a sculptor, who set to work on a statue of the king,
which gradually cost 700,000 dollars, but was not
finished. When Frederick V. died, the country was
in a hopeless state of ruin. The army and navy were
neglected, the state debt was frightfully swollen, the
taxing power of the country was exhausted, and the
morals of the higher classes were utterly corrupted,
while the lower classes were sullenly murmuring. Into
this chaos of poverty, necessity, and discontent, the
youthful king, it was expected, would introduce order,
and hopes were entertained of him as the regenerator
of Denmark.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 14, Privy Councillor von
Bernstorff appeared on the balcony of the Christiansborg
palace, and declared, in the traditional manner
and with the words: "King Frederick V. is dead;
King Christian VII. is living;" the late crown prince
ruler of the united kingdoms. To which the people
replied: "May he not only live long, but reign well,
like his father."</p>

<p>During the late king's illness, the crown prince had
been very sad, which the courtiers had regarded as a
sign of sensibility; but those who were intimate with
him were aware that he was oppressed by the fear of
reigning. Reverdil inspired him with some degree of
courage; and he went through the ceremonial receptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with a grace that charmed the entire court. No
immediate change occurred in the ministry; but, for
all that, the supreme power passed into other hands.
The son did not inherit the father's great predilection
for minister Moltke. On the contrary, the young king
regarded the minister as a man who had misapplied
his influence over the late king to his own selfish ends.
These notions were suggested to him by Reventlow,
who, though he deserved reproach in other respects, was
honest, and hence not well disposed toward Moltke,
whom he considered the fosterer of the great extravagance
which had been carried on with the finances of
the state under Frederick V.</p>

<p>Reventlow was so assured of his unbounded influence
over the king, as to feel convinced that he would
govern the kingdom in future. In pursuance of this,
he had the drawers in his office endorsed&mdash;Denmark,
Norway, the Duchies; and showed the king this arrangement,
with the remark: "Here I shall keep the
papers of the two kingdoms; and there those belonging
to the duchy." The king smiled at the impertinence,
and said nothing. At any rate, it did not cause
him anger; for, ere long, he lavished marks of favour
on Reventlow and his relations. On the day of his
succession, he nominated his ex-governor chief gentleman
of the bed-chamber; and a fortnight later, on the
occasion of the king's birthday, the insignia of the
Order of the Elephant, the highest in Denmark, were
bestowed on Reventlow. On the same day, the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
also appointed Von Sperling, his former page of the
chamber, and a nephew of Reventlow, his third
equerry.</p>

<p>This young gentleman possessed considerable influence
over the king. Though not distinguished by any
great ability, he was a handsome man, with an agreeable
temper. From the day when the crown prince
had an establishment of his own, he had been his page,
and had cleverly contrived to acquire the friendship of
his master, which he now intended to <em>exploiter</em> for his
own advantage. According to Reverdil, this intimacy
had a very deleterious effect on the crown prince; for
Sperling was older than his master, and a thorough
debauchee. He filled the prince's mind with dangerous
knowledge, and contrived to influence his imagination
and corrupt his heart.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The country had no cause, either, to rejoice at the
intimacy; for Sperling, through his indulgence in sensual
pleasures, offered a bad example to the king, who,
as it was, did not require example. The result of his
strict education was, that he determined, so soon as he
became his own master, to indulge in every form of
vice, out of sheer obstinacy. A more dangerous man in
this respect, however, was the king's valet, John Kirchoff.
Reventlow did a real service, by removing this
man from the presence of the king. On February 11,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the valet was dismissed with a pension of 1,200 dollars,
and his debts, amounting to 3,000 dollars, were paid
by the treasury. But Reventlow, hearing that Kirchoff,
instead of being grateful, was conspiring against him,
ordered him to leave Copenhagen in a week; and he
proceeded to Norway.</p>

<p>Shortly after his accession, Christian had an idea of
becoming a great general, and imagined that he would
surpass Frederick the Great. He often regretted to
his cousin, Prince Charles of Hesse, that he was born
on a throne, and believed that he could have raised
himself to it by his talents and deserts, if he had been
born in the lowest class. He had an unbridled passion
for female society, but had not, as yet, found an
object on which to fix his affections. He had been
imbued with very strict religious principles, which he
could not combat, and which he consequently wished
to destroy. He and Prince Charles frequently spoke
about religion; and the latter strove to soften the severity
of the king's views, by leading him back to the
love of God. One afternoon, when the prince went to
Christian, he found him greatly troubled in mind, because
he had to take the communion the next morning.
The prince spoke about it as the most blessed and
significant of religious rites. They conversed for a
long time, and the king was greatly affected; saying,
of his own accord, that it was impossible for Christ
not to have existed, and fulfilled, by His sacrifice, the
very words of the institution of the holy supper, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ever since Christianity had been known, every sect,
whatever might be its doctrine and heresy, had retained
the sacrament. The two young men then
prayed together, and the king was greatly moved.
Going up soon after to the queen-mother, he went
into her room, saying: "Grandmamma cannot guess
what we have been doing?" The queen being unable
to do so, Christian added: "We have been praying
together, and were very pious;" and then almost died
of laughing.</p>

<p>The young king had scarce taken up his residence
at Christiansborg ere he had an affair of honour, if it
may be so called, with a page of his chamber. The
latter was a very honest and good youth. The king,
before going to bed, maintained the opinion, that a
king, who was at the same time a great general, was
more than another king. The other, doubtless, willing
to check the king's military ambition, thought himself
obliged to defend the contrary view. Christian became
very angry; and the reasonings of the page at length
rendered the monarch so wild, that he gave his opponent
a box on the ears. The latter went the next
morning to complain to the grand chamberlain, Count
Reventlow. The count was of opinion that the affair
could not be passed over in silence; and made the
page write a letter, in which he spoke strongly about
the honour of a gentleman. The letter was dated
from Kiöge, to which place the page pretended that he
had retired. The king took the matter in very ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
part; and Count Reventlow coming soon after to scold
him, the king was not particularly pleased with him
either. The matter ended here, and the page came
back from the room in which he was hidden,&mdash;the king
having stated that he bore no malice against the man,
and that it was merely an outbreak of vivacity against
an opposition which had displeased him.</p>

<p>These little scenes happened daily, and aided no little
in causing the king to assume a higher tone. One
day he had such a quarrel with the grand chamberlain,
that the latter almost fainted. The king then became
alarmed, and fetched a glass of water for him to drink:
the chamberlain recovered, but insisted on retiring
from his post. Queen Sophia Magdalena, who was
Reventlow's great protector, sent for Prince Charles,
and begged him, on every account, to patch up this
affair, which had been carried too far on both sides.
When the prince proceeded to the king, the latter
spoke first about the affair, and gave his cousin an opportunity
for representing the injury he did himself in
the eyes of the public by dismissing his old governor.
The king yielded; sent for Reventlow, spoke to him
kindly, and begged him to forget the affair.</p>

<p>The representations which the prince was frequently
obliged to make to the king against his decided opinions,
naturally rendered their daily conversations less agreeable
than at the outset. However, everything still
went on tolerably well; and the king felt that his
cousin had no other interest in what he said than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
welfare of the kingdom. But gradually disputes about
religion began. The king's desire for the society of
females, and the strictness of his religious principles,
were constantly in opposition. After speaking to his
dangerous friends, who inspired him with the most relaxed
principles about religion, Christian only saw one
way of escape&mdash;by breaking with his own convictions.
Prince Charles noticed this in Christian's dark humour:
his love of gaiety changed to bitter remarks, and a desire
to find occasions to quarrel about trifles. Seeing
this almost insurmountable wish to break out in debauchery,
Prince Charles thought it his duty to tell the
king frankly that he could not do better than conclude,
as soon as possible, his marriage with the princess who
had been promised him. Christian regarded marriage
as the greatest possible bore; but Charles, who was then
engaged to the king's sister, looked at it very differently.
The king, however, told his cousin to speak to Bernstorff
on the subject; and the latter, understanding the state
of matters, resolved to hurry the royal marriage on.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A man, who distinguished himself in the naval history
of the north, Count Frederick von Danneskjold
Samsöe,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> a grandson of King Christian V. and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Countess von Samsöe, who had been in the service of
the state during the early years of Frederick V.'s reign,
happened to be in Copenhagen at this time; and the
young monarch ordered him to draw up a general survey
of the condition of the kingdom. The count had
performed the task by January 23. Danneskjold was
a sincere friend of his country, but of a reckless and
violent character. In his exposé, he threw the fault
of the numerous defects and the mismanagement which
he discovered in the administration, upon Bernstorff,
and accused that minister of increasing the national
debt. He declared that the marriage arranged with an
English princess was displeasing to the nation. Bernstorff
despised the Danes, and only appointed foreigners
as officials. He favoured luxury by protection, and
had allowed the army to fall into decay. The commercial
treaty with Morocco had done the country the
greatest injury; and finally, Bernstorff had revoked a
royal decree about embroidery on clothes, and thus
insulted the hereditary sovereign.</p>

<p>Although Count Danneskjold stood in high favour
with the Queen Dowager Sophia Magdalena, who during
the early part of the new reign had great power
over the king, he was unable to overthrow Bernstorff.
On the contrary, there were many signs that Bernstorff's
influence had grown under the new king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Count St. Germain, however, was dismissed from the
presidency of the War Ministry, which he had himself
established, and Privy Councillor von Rosenkranz took
his place.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Bernstorff, Reventlow, and Moltke, formed from this
time a triumvirate. Twice a week the privy council
of state attended the king, but rarely left him a choice
between two opinions. If the king expressed an idea
that varied from theirs, they looked serious, and offered
a protest, upon which the timid Christian at once held
his tongue, and sanctioned the measure. Of course
this conduct on the part of the gentlemen displeased
the king, the more so because he had no very high
opinion of them. That he did not love Reventlow,
whose rough mode of education he had not yet forgotten,
is only natural; Moltke he knew to be a man
who only regarded his own interests, while Bernstorff's
vanity and cringing subserviency were repulsive
to him. To this must be added, that the wearisome
way in which the discussions were carried on horribly
bored the young king; and many were of opinion that
this was purposely done by the triumvirate, in order
to disgust the king with governing. They cared very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
little how Christian spent his time, or what associates
he selected, so long as there was no evident attempt to
tear the power from them. For this reason, several
men of talent, whom they feared, were removed from
the king's person.</p>

<p>The royal family consisted, at this time, of the
widows of the two last kings,&mdash;Sophia Magdalena and
Juliana Maria, the son of the latter, the hereditary
Prince Frederick, and the three princesses&mdash;Charlotte
Amelia, a sister of Christian VI., and Sophia Magdalena,
and Louisa, sisters of Christian VII. A third
sister of the king, Wilhelmina Caroline, was married
to William I., Elector of Hesse Cassel.</p>

<p>The old queen, Sophia Magdalena, a princess of
Brandenburg Kulmbach by birth, had exercised great
influence over public affairs during the sixteen years
of her husband's reign, and would have gladly done
the same now. Juliana Maria had, as yet, not interfered
at all in state affairs, although she doubtless
strove to acquire influence as much as her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Reventlow, who probably felt that he was not as
securely seated in power as he would have liked,
hence looked about for a supporter, and found a most
willing one in the king's grandmother. By laying
aside her former haughty demeanour, she contrived to
gain considerable influence over the king, and gave
way to all his whims, in order that she might keep
him in her leading-strings. One day, the king, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
was continually playing tricks, when dining at Hirschholm
took up the sugar-dredger, slipped behind grandmamma's
chair, and began sprinkling her hair.</p>

<p>"What is your Majesty about?" the old lady asked.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry with me, dearest grandmamma,"
the king said; "I am your sweetest Christian, you
know."</p>

<p>The queen smiled, and swallowed the pill in silence.</p>

<p>Such jokes caused the young king, even at that time,
great amusement. Once, when he was at the theatre
with a circle of brilliant courtiers, wearing his gold-embroidered
admiral's uniform, he walked up and
down the back of the royal box with a grin on his
face, which was always a sign that he was meditating
some trick. In one of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entr'actes</i>, when tea was
handed round, a young lady was trying to cool the
hot fluid by blowing it, when the king crept up to her
and blew such a blast into the cup that its entire contents
spirted about. The king quickly turned on his
heel, and laughed so heartily and childishly that the
lady could not but forgive the trick which had procured
him a few merry moments.</p>

<p>With the summer, fresh proofs of Sophia Magdalena's
powerful influence were given. She heartily
detested Count Moltke, because he had contrived to
keep her aloof from the business of the state, and she
now, after an interval of sixteen years, wished to
avenge herself on him. The favourable moment had
arrived. The king did not think that Moltke had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
truly served his country. Reventlow desired nothing
more than the downfall of his brother-in-law, and
Bernstorff no longer required the powerful patron
who had gained him his ministerial post.</p>

<p>At the beginning of summer, the king, accompanied
by his relatives, visited various public resorts,&mdash;among
others, the park, on St. John's day, when a great public
festival is held there annually. During a visit which
the king paid to the convent of Wallö, which was
founded by Sophia Magdalena, the latter succeeded in
overthrowing the detested premier. The order which
stripped him of all his offices, except the presidency of
the Academy, was handed to him by Privy Councillor
von Plessen, whom Moltke had previously turned out
of office. Moltke was dismissed without a pension,
and retired to his estate of Bregentved, which had
been given him by Frederick V.</p>

<p>The old queen wished to place Danneskjold Samsöe
in Moltke's place. For this object, she persuaded the
king to summon him to the privy council, and he was
soon after re-appointed to his old office of "Surintendant
de la Marine," with a salary of 8,000 dollars.
Rosenkrantz was also driven into the background at the
same time as Moltke, and no one regretted his fall.</p>

<p>Space fails me to record all the intrigues that went
on for the next few months, or how Bernstorff was all
but overthrown by the jealousy of Danneskjold, and
only owed his salvation to the generous intercession of
Reverdil and the king's latest favourite, Prince Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of Hesse.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Bernstorff was appointed Director of the
Sound Dues, the most profitable state office, and the
king imparted to him the charges which Danneskjold
had brought against him. Bernstorff triumphantly
refuted them, and appeared more secure of the royal
favour than ever.</p>

<p>It was the usage for the kings of Denmark to visit
their states during the first two years of their reign.
Christian did not devote the summer of 1766 to any
journey, as he was engaged with the marriage of his
two sisters. The younger was married to Prince
Charles of Hesse; the elder to the hereditary prince
of Sweden. The latter alliance was the result of an
old engagement contracted with the Swedish nation
while the prince was still a boy. The Queen of
Sweden, sister of the King of Prussia, would have
gladly broken off the marriage, and given her son a
princess of her own family; but the Estates insisted.
The Danish ministers would sooner have advised war
than accept such an affront.</p>

<p>These marriages being satisfactorily arranged, Christian
VII. bethought himself of his own wife, for whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
he did not feel so great a yearning as he had done a
year previously, ere he had become his own master,
and tasted the nocturnal delights of the capital in the
far from cleanly company of his friend Von Sperling.
The marriage had been originally arranged for 1767,
but Christian's ministers and friends, seeing his tendency
to libertinism, had wisely, as they thought,
hurried it on. The sober Danes were beginning to
mutter about the scandals which took place at night in
the quiet streets of the Residenz. They had probably
never heard of our Prince Hal, and hence could find
no excuse for the wild sallies of their young monarch,
in which he broke glasses and furniture, attacked
watchmen, and more than once was taken into custody.
Being such a roué as regards women, it appears surprising
that Christian VII. consented to marry at so
early an age; but it is probable that some latent suspicions
about the designs of Juliana Maria urged him
to listen to the advice of his friends. Hence, when
the news reached him that Caroline Matilda was arriving,
he hastened with a very good affectation of
lover-like eagerness to meet her.</p>

<p>The royal couple saw each other for the first time at
Roeskilde, four (German) miles from the Danish capital,
where Christian VII., accompanied by the hereditary
Prince Frederick and his own brother-in-law,
Prince Charles of Hesse, welcomed Caroline Matilda.
We can easily forgive the young king, if, at the sight
of such beauty as hers, he forgot court proprieties,
and embraced and kissed his bride at Roeskilde in the
presence of the company. My readers will remember
a precisely similar instance at the meeting of a princess
of Denmark and a Prince of Wales, not so very long
ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Judging from the mere exterior, Christian VII.
ought to have produced an equally favourable impression
on the heart of Caroline Matilda. The person of
the young king, though considerably under the middle
height, was finely proportioned: light and compact,
but yet possessing a considerable degree of agility and
strength. His complexion was remarkably fair; his
features, if not handsome, were regular; his eyes blue,
lively, and expressive; his hair very light; he had a
good forehead and aquiline nose; a handsome mouth
and fine set of teeth. He was elegant rather than
magnificent in his dress; courteous in his manners; of
a very amorous constitution; warm and irritable in
his temper; but his anger, if soon excited, was easily
appeased; and he was generous to profusion.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>From Roeskilde, the young queen was conducted
to the palace of Frederiksberg, close to Copenhagen,
where she stopped till Nov. 8, on which day she made
her solemn entrance into the capital, seated by the
side of her sister-in-law, the Landgravine Louise, and
under the escort of all the grand dignitaries of the
crown. The marriage ceremony was then performed
in the palace chapel.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">kehraus</i> was danced at the ball, and was led by
Prince Charles of Hesse, who had his wife as partner,
while Christian danced with Caroline Matilda. Suddenly
the king, who was in very good spirits, shouted
to Prince Charles, "Lead the kehraus through all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>apartments." He passed through several rooms, and,
on reaching the queen's ante-room, the king ordered
him to enter her rooms, which he did. Frau von
Plessen, however, rushed at Prince Charles like a
dragon, and declared that he should never enter the
queen's bedroom. The king, hearing this speech, said
to the prince, "Don't bother yourself about an old
woman's twaddle." The prince, therefore, continued
the dance, and passed through the queen's bedroom.
Frau von Plessen made a tremendous noise, which
greatly displeased the king.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In honour of the day, a large silver medal was
struck, which displayed on the obverse the busts and
names of the newly-married pair; and on the reverse,
an allegorical female form, reclining upon an anchor,
and holding a wreath of flowers in her hand, with the
motto, "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Recurrentibus signis</i>." Numerous orders and
titles were distributed in commemoration of this auspicious
event.</p>

<p>The young queen, it is evident, won golden opinions
from all manner of men. Even the Danish author of
the "Secret History" is compelled to avow: "I saw
this ill-fated princess when she first set her foot on the
soil of. Denmark. I did not join in the shouts of the
multitude; but I was charmed with her appearance.
Everything she saw was grandeur and festivity; she
was received like a divinity, and almost worshipped, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
least by those of the masculine gender. Her animated,
beautiful features, her fine blue eyes, beamed with
delight on all around her."</p>

<p>The English envoy was so delighted at Caroline
Matilda's reception, that he wrote home at once:&mdash;"The
princess seems to gain approbation and affection
wherever she shows herself, and those more closely
connected with her praise unanimously and in the
highest terms her disposition and conduct." The
English cabinet, however, did not put entire faith in
this enthusiasm. The youth of the princess could not
but cause anxiety, because the king, her husband,
was, so to speak, a child too. Hence the court of St.
James sent the British agent the following warning
advice in reply to the above outburst:&mdash;"Her Majesty
is entering on the most important period of her life.
At so tender an age she has been sent forth alone into
a foreign distant ocean, where it will be necessary to
exercise the highest caution and good sense, and to
steer with thoughtful attention, in order that she may
at the same time succeed in gaining the love of her
court and people, and maintain the dignity of the
exalted position to which Providence has summoned
her."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The warning was not unfounded. There are good
grounds for believing that Christian, during the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
between his engagement and marriage, had been entangled
in other snares. It could hardly have been
otherwise, when we bear in mind the deleterious influences
brought to bear on him, and the temptations
to which a boy who had been so severely educated was
exposed, when he found himself his own master at the
unripe age of seventeen. I do not hesitate to assert
that the worst influences had been at work on the
young king's mind and senses, and the following confirms
my assertion. We have seen that the marriage
took place on November 8, and on November 25,
Ogier, the sharp-sighted French envoy at Copenhagen,
considered himself justified in reporting to Paris:&mdash;"The
princess has produced hardly any impression on
the king's heart, and had she been even more amiable,
she would have experienced the same fate. For, how
could she please a man who most seriously believes
that it is not fashionable (n'est pas du bon air) for a
husband to love his wife?" A pretty specimen, forsooth,
of the effect of the mistress doctrine which was
omnipotent in the eighteenth century! We see that
poor Christian, in a few short months, had made frightfully
rapid progress in the corruption of his age. As
Reverdil tells us, with a groan, "a royal person in his
bed appeared to him rather an object of respect than
of love."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen's household had been previously appointed,
and Frau von Plessen, daughter of Privy
Councillor von Berkentin, was selected as grand
mistress so far back as August. The choice was a
most unfortunate one, for this lady, although respectable,
was austere, haughty, and decidedly in opposition.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Her apartments were twice a week the meeting-place
of all the malcontents, and the ministers and
old courtiers, after dining with the king, went there
to lament over the backslidings and corrupt society of
the young people by whom the king was surrounded.
Still, this choice, though unwise, was not so pernicious
as that of Fräulein von Eyben as lady in waiting.</p>

<p>The good understanding among the other members
of the royal family did not at first appear to be disturbed
by the king's marriage. It is true that Sophia
Magdalena, who was sixty-six years of age, and whose
heart was distracted between fear of God and ambition,
could not thoroughly sympathise with the girlish
Caroline Matilda, but it is probable that she was the
more willing to forgive her her youth and beauty,
because she did not apprehend any political rival in
her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Juliana Maria, the king's step-mother, did not at
first display any open hostility to the young queen.
That she hated her as an obstacle to the advancement
of her own son, there can be no doubt, or that she
had made various underhand efforts to prevent the
marriage. She was obliged to be cautious, however:
she was not popular with the nation, and had held no
sway over her husband, who toward the end of his
reign hated and avoided a woman who was the opposite
of his prematurely lost Louisa. Hence Juliana
Maria hailed Matilda as the consort of Christian VII.
with well-dissembled smiles and flattering blandishments.
This task, however painful, she performed in
her best style, and if her malice had not been so notorious,
Matilda might have believed she should find
an affectionate friend&mdash;a second mother in Juliana
Maria.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Princess Charlotte Amelia, the king's aunt, only
lived for religious practices and charity. She inhabited
the palace of Amalienborg, named after her,
in the great royal market, which is now the Academy,
and the memory of her benefactions to the poor still
flourishes among the Danish people.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Princess Louise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the king's dearly loved sister, had only shortly before
been married, and felt herself much too happy to envy
her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the young queen one festival
followed another, to which the public were generally
admitted, although some amusements were reserved
for the court, to which only the élite were invited.
At the commencement of Christian's reign only Danish
plays and ballets were performed at the theatre, but
now the king ordered a French troupe from Paris,
who first gave their performances on the Danish stage,
but afterwards in a theatre expressly prepared for
them in the Christiansborg.</p>

<p>On December 4, the first masquerade was given at
the palace to the first six classes, to which all the
officers of the garrison and the foreign envoys were
invited. During the reign of Frederick V., jovial
though it was, no attempt had been made to introduce
such mummeries, as the sober Danes called them, but
Christian considered that he could go to any lengths.</p>

<p>The court, yearning for amusements of every description,
even resolved to give theatrical performances,
in which the king and suite played the chief parts.
Among other pieces performed was Voltaire's <cite>Zaire</cite>,
which exactly suited Christian's taste. It was played
in the original, and the king represented one of the
principal characters with great applause. At first, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
a select circle was admitted to the performances, but,
gradually, the public were invited as well.</p>

<p>But while the court amused themselves, the public,
generally, murmured. At the head of the malcontents
was Reventlow, who would rush into Frau von Plessen's
apartments, brandishing the bills sent in to him
for payment, and objurgating fiercely. His nephew,
Von Sperling, knew how to stir up his bile, by casting
on those whom he wished to injure the mad expenses
which he had himself suggested. It was he, in fact,
who most contributed to bring into fashion theatricals
and masked balls. The youth of the king, and the
ennui which began at an early period to oppress him,
supplied an excuse for these expensive amusements,
which were madness in a poor and indebted state. Still,
the public might have pardoned it if the court had managed
to attract respect, for nations, though victims to
the magnificence of their sovereigns, readily forgive,
and even take a pride in lavish expenditure when they
believe they share it; but the king, indulging in the
most puerile amusements, running without object from
one palace to the other, and decried by the complaints
of his own ministers about his private conduct, entirely
forfeited public respect. A proof of this was furnished
during the first winter of his reign. A building belonging
to the palace, from which it was only separated
by a canal, and in which was a brewery with an immense
wood store, having caught fire, Münter,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
German preacher, took advantage of the occasion to
preach a sermon against the king's person and the
amusements of the court. He represented the misfortunes
of the nation as being at their height and irremediable,
unless Providence granted immediate help,
and unless the warning just given produced a salutary
effect. This sermon, it is true, caused the preacher
a reprimand, but it was greatly applauded by austere
persons and devotees.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>And what did Caroline Matilda think of her reception?
An opinion can be formed from the following
interesting letter which she wrote home, describing her
voyage and arrival in Copenhagen, to her brother the
Duke of York:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="p5"><i>Copenhagen, December 25, 1766.</i><br />

<span class="smcap">Sir and dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>As this epistle will exceed the bounds of a common
letter, you may call it Travels through part of Germany
and Denmark, with some cursory remarks on the
genius and manners of the people.</p>

<p>Our navigation, though fortunate enough, seemed
to me tedious and uncomfortable. I almost wished a
contrary wind had driven me back to that coast from
which I had sailed with so much regret. Were I a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
man, I do not think I should envy you the mighty
post of admiral, as I am a true coward on the main.
Though I found the opposite shore very different from
that of England, in regard to populousness, agriculture,
roads and conveniences for travelling, I was glad to be
safely landed, and vowed to Neptune never to invade
his empire; only wishing that he would be graciously
pleased to let me have another passage to the Queen of
the Isles. What I have seen of Germany exhibits a
contrast of barren lands and some few cultivated spots;
here and there some emaciated cattle, inhospitable
forests, castles with turrets and battlements out of
repair, half inhabited by counts and barons of the Holy
Empire, wretched cottages, multitudes of soldiers, and
a few husbandmen; pride and ceremonial on one side,
slavery and abjection on the other.</p>

<p>As for principalities, every two or three hours I
entered the dominions of a new sovereign; and, indeed,
often I passed through the place of their highnesses'
residence without being able to guess that it was the
seat of these little potentates; I only judged by the
antiquity of their palaces, falling to ruins, that these
princes may justly boast of a race of illustrious progenitors,
as it seemed they had lived there from time
immemorial. As we judge of everything by comparison,
I observed that there is more comfort, more elegance,
more conveniency, in the villa of a citizen of
London than in these gloomy mansions, hung up with
rotten tapestries, where a serene highness <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">meurt d'ennui</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in all the state of a monarch, amongst a few attendants,
called master of the horse, grand ecuyer, grand
chamberlain, without appointments. There is no such
thing here as a middle class of people living in affluence
and independence.</p>

<p>Both men and women of fashion affect to dress more
rich than elegant. The female part of the burghers'
families at Hamburg and Altona dress inconceivably
fantastic. The most unhappy part of the Germans are
the tenants of the little needy princes, who squeeze
them to keep up their own grandeur. These petty
sovereigns, ridiculously proud of titles, ancestry, and
show, give no sort of encouragement to the useful arts,
though industry, application, and perseverance, are the
characteristics of the German nation, especially the
mechanical part of it.</p>

<p>The roads are almost impassable. The carriages of
the nobility and gentry infinitely worse than the stage-coaches
in England; and the inns want all the accommodations
they are intended for.</p>

<p>You may easily imagine that the sight of a new
queen, from the position of the kingdom to the capital,
brought upon my passage great crowds of people from
the adjacent towns and villages, yet I believe you may
see more on a fair day from Charing Cross to the
Royal Exchange than I have met upon the road from
Altona to Copenhagen. The gentlemen and ladies
who were sent to compliment me, and increased my
retinue, made no addition to my entertainment. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the reservedness and gravity peculiar to their
nation, they thought it was a mark of respect and
submission never to presume to answer me but by
monosyllables.</p>

<p>What I have seen of Danish Holstein and of the
duchy of Schleswig, is well watered, and produces
plenty of corn. The inhabitants of those countries
differ little or nothing from other Germans. Some
parts of Jutland consist of barren mountains; but the
valleys are, in general, well inhabited and fruitful.
The face of the country presents a number of large
forests, but I did not see a river navigable for a barge
of the same burden as those that come up the river
Thames to London. Spring and autumn are seasons
scarcely known here; to the sultry heat of August
succeeds a severe winter, and the frost continues for
eight months, and with little alteration. It seems as
if the soil were unfavourable to vegetable productions,
for those that have been procured for my table, at a
great expense, were unsavoury, and of the worst kind.
As game is here in plenty, and the coasts are generally
well supplied with fish, I could have lived very well
on these two articles had they been better dressed, but
their cookery, which is a mixture of Danish and German
ingredients, cannot be agreeable to an English palate.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to learn the language of the
country, which is a harsh dialect of the Teutonic.
The little French and High-Dutch I know will be of
great service to me at court, where they are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
spoken with a bad accent and a vicious pronunciation.
The peasants, as to property, are still in a state of
vassalage; and the nobility, who are slaves at court,
tyrannize over their inferiors and tenants in their dominions.
These poor husbandmen, with such discouragements
to industry, are obliged to maintain
the cavalry in victuals and lodgings; likewise to
furnish them with money. These disadvantages,
added to their natural indolence, make this valuable
class of people less useful and more needy than in free
states, where they enjoy, in common with other subjects,
that freedom which is a spur to industry. You
must not expect any conveniency and accommodation
in their inns; all those I found upon the road had been
provided by the court.</p>

<p>Copenhagen, though a small capital, makes no contemptible
appearance at a distance. All the artillery
of the castles and forts, with the warlike music of the
guards and divers companies of burghers, in rich uniforms,
announced my entry into this royal residence.
I was conducted, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants,
to the palace, when the king, the queen
dowager, and Prince Frederick, her son, with the
nobility of both sexes, who had, on this occasion, displayed
all their finery, received me with extraordinary
honours, according to the etiquette. The king's youth,
good nature, and levity, require no great penetration to
be discerned in his taste, amusements, and his favourites.
He seems all submission to the queen, who has got over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
him such an ascendancy as her arts and ambition seem
likely to preserve. Her darling son, whom she wished
not to be removed a step farther from the throne, is
already proud and aspiring like herself.</p>

<p>I have been more than once mortified with the
superior knowledge and experience for which the
queen takes care to praise herself, and offended at
the want of respect and attention in the prince. As
such unmerited slights cannot be resented without an
open rupture, I rather bear with them than disunite
the royal family, and appear the cause of court cabals,
by showing my displeasure. It seems the king teaches
his subjects, by example, the doctrine of passive obedience.
Few of the courtiers look like gentlemen;
and their ladies appear, in the circle, inanimate, like
the wax figures in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>I have been lately at Frederiksborg. It is a magnificent
house, built in the modern taste, but ill-contrived,
and situated in the most unhealthy soil, in the
middle of a lake. The paintings and furniture are
truly royal.</p>

<p>To remind me that I am mortal, I have visited the
cathedral church of Roeskilde, where the kings and
queens of Denmark were formerly buried. Several of
their monuments still exist, which are, as well as this
ancient structure, of a Gothic taste.</p>

<p>As you flatter me with the pleasure of seeing you
soon in Copenhagen, I postpone mentioning other particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
till this agreeable interview, and remain, with
British sincerity,</p>

<p class="center">Sir, and dear brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Your most affectionate sister,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><span class="smcap">Matilda Caroline</span>.</span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If any differences subsisted between the couple at
this time, they did not reach the public knowledge;
and the conduct of Caroline Matilda was that of a most
devoted wife. Thus, when Christian was attacked in
April, 1767, by a scarlet fever, which was thought
infectious, the queen assiduously attended him; nor
would she leave him, day or night, till his life was
out of danger. On the following May 1, their Majesties'
coronation was performed in the chapel of the
Christiansborg Palace, by the Bishop of Seeland. On
this occasion, his Majesty assumed the motto of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gloria
ex amore patriæ</i>. As the kings of Denmark do not
receive the crown from any other hands than their
own, the ceremony of putting it on is performed by
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It was about this time that Prince
Charles first entertained doubts as to Christian's
sanity. He imparted his suspicions to Bernstorff,
who acknowledged the truth of his remark, for Count
de St. Germain had spoken to him about it, and said:
"The king has a singular and very rare malady; in
France we call it <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fou de c&oelig;ur</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet a cloud was gathering, at first no bigger than
a man's hand, which would soon overcast this apparently
happy life. Frau von Plessen strove for influence
and power. If she could so contrive that Caroline
Matilda should attain as much mastery over Christian
VII. as Sophia Magdalena had held over Christian VI.,
she, as her confidante, would easily be able to direct
matters as she pleased. The speculating lady, unfortunately,
fancied she had discovered the best way of
effecting this, by advising the young queen to behave
more reservedly towards her husband, who&mdash;so the
clever lady-in-waiting calculated&mdash;would become all
the more in love with his beautiful wife, and more indulgent
to her wishes.</p>

<p>The inexperienced Caroline Matilda but too readily
followed the advice of her grand mistress, and hence-forward
behaved with coy reserve and assumed coldness
toward her hot-blooded husband. When he
wished to pay the queen an evening visit, he was put
off with various excuses, and it was not till he had repeatedly
requested an interview with his wife that he
was admitted.</p>

<p>Christian, whom any opposition drove to a state
bordering on madness, determined to make a tour in
Holstein, where he could give way to his propensities
unchecked. The queen greatly wished to accompany
her husband, which he declined, and the first serious
quarrel took place. She was the more to be pitied,
honest Reverdil tells us, because she was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and, through an instinct common to nearly all wives,
had grown into an inclination for the father of her
child. She attributed her disgrace to Count von
Holck, who very probably strengthened the king in
his resolution. Consequently, she insisted that he
should be left behind as well, and it was not without
difficulty that she obtained so weak and humiliating a
vengeance.</p>

<p>Reverdil did his best to patch up this quarrel. He
urged the king to write his wife the most affectionate
letters, and, as Reverdil composed them himself, the
queen was to some degree pacified. The account
which Reverdil gives us of the royal tour is very
lamentable. Christian offended the old Danish nobility
by his frivolity and recklessness, while his amusements
were so puerile, and the courtiers whom he
appeared to prefer so unfitted, that very unfavourable
judgments were formed of him.</p>

<p>While staying at Traventhal, the king talked a great
deal about the travelling scheme, which he carried out
soon after. He wanted it to be different, however,
from what it really became. He would have liked to
forget business and etiquette, become a private person,
and try what success his personal qualities would obtain
him in society. He strove very hard to persuade
Reverdil to accompany him across the frontier with
one valet, and it was not till the Swiss refused point
blank to go that the king gave up his design.</p>

<p>During Christian's absence, Caroline Matilda received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
a terrible shock from the death of her beloved
brother, the Duke of York. The young prince left
England in August, and proceeded to Paris, where he
was magnificently fêted. While he was in France, the
Queen of Denmark wrote him the following letter:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="p5"><i>To H.R.H. Edward, Duke of York.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir and dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>You are now in a kingdom that I should like to
see in preference to all the countries in Europe,
though I am sure my curiosity will never be gratified
in that respect. You may, perhaps, attribute this
desire to the levity of our sex, which has a strong
analogy to the volatile genius of the French. No,&mdash;my
motive is, that I should be glad to see at home
those people who have been for so many centuries
past our rivals in arts and army. Pray write to me
a good account of Paris, which, I am informed, must
yield the precedency to modern London. When you
go to the south of France, I am so unreasonable as to
expect another account of the provinces. Take care
of your health, and let not all the princesses of Europe
make you forget.</p>

<p class="center">Your most affectionate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The duke had reached Monaco in his travels, and
died there on Sept. 17, after a malignant fever which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lasted fourteen days. The blow, so unexpected, was
severely felt by the whole family, and by none more
than Caroline Matilda, who had been keeping her own
troubles locked in her bosom, till she could impart
them to an affectionate brother, whose arrival she so
fully expected. In the first outburst of her sorrow,
she wrote the following touching letter to her mother,
the Princess Dowager of Wales:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="p5"><span class="smcap">Madam and revered Mother</span>,</p>

<p>Give me leave to condole with your royal highness
in the loss of your dutiful son, and my beloved brother,
the Duke of York. I feel, with my own grief, your
sorrow. I beg you will convey the same sentiments
to his Majesty the King, my brother. When I reflect
on the circumstances of the untimely death of this
amiable prince in a foreign land, and perhaps deprived
of the comfort and assistance he should have found in
his native country, I still more lament his fate. I am
extremely concerned for your royal highness's indisposition;
but I hope this melancholy event, which
maternal tenderness cannot but severely feel, as it was
ordered by the unfathomable decrees of Providence,
will be so far reconciled to your superior understanding
and piety, as to adore and to submit.</p>

<p class="center">I am, with great deference,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your Royal Highness's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Respectful daughter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;"><span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the king returned from his Holstein tour, it
was arranged that the queen should drive seven or
eight leagues from Copenhagen to meet him. He
received her with all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">empressement</i> of which he
was capable; he got into her carriage, and those
who were only imperfectly acquainted with the state
of things might imagine that he was resuming his true
place.</p>

<p>But the conduct which the queen had before assumed
in the hope of entirely winning her husband's
affection, was now dictated by resentment. The party
of Juliana Maria, who desired a separation between the
couple, had informed Caroline Matilda of her husband's
conduct while absent, and the result was a decided
coldness. This produced such savageness in the king,
and he was so dissatisfied, that he complained about
his consort in the presence of his domestics. This was
a famous opening for these creatures, who took all possible
trouble to direct Christian's attention to other
ladies. One of the royal runners, of the name of
Hjorth, hence said to the king one day that it would
be easy to avenge himself for the queen's coldness, as
there were plenty of fair dames who would accept the
king's visits more than willingly. His Majesty only
required to keep a mistress, and such a person his most
gracious master could find at any moment. Hjorth
proposed to the king a well-known Hetæra, called
"Stiefelett-Kathrine," on account of her beautiful feet,
whose acquaintance the pander had, probably, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
beforehand.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Christian willingly assented, saw the
girl, found her pretty and insinuating, and entered into
the unfortunate connexion with her, by which he was
led into the most horrible and open profligacy.</p>

<p>The leader of these orgies was Count Conrad von
Holck, a scampish and good-tempered young fellow, of
the same age as the king. The ministers, who should
have kept a watchful eye on everything that might
have an injurious effect on the character of the young
king, were not sorry to see the autocrat yielding to
the seductive influences of his loose favourite. But
Count Conrad in no way betrayed the slightest desire
to interfere in the business of the state, and was consequently
harmless.</p>

<p>The growing influence of this minion drove from
court the only honest man remaining at it. One evening,
Holck promised Milady a box at the theatre, and
Reverdil saw her sitting above the maids of honour,
who were facing the queen. Being at the time close
to Holck, the virtuous Swiss could not refrain from
speaking out. "Sir," he said, "though you may turn
into ridicule a hundred times an expression which I
have frequent occasion to repeat, I say again, that a
man can be neither a good subject, nor a good servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
who does not weep to see such a creature thus defy
the queen, and the king make himself, to the great peril
of the state, the <em>greluchon</em> of a foreign minister." The
next day Reverdil received a written order from the
king to leave Copenhagen in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The first important sign of the king's most favourable
sentiments toward the young protégé was Holck's
appointment, on December 21, 1767, as Court Marshal.
From this time Count Holck managed all the festivities
at court, where comedies, balls, masquerades, and
excursions followed each other uninterruptedly. The
king, however, preferred, to all these distractions, any
opportunity of yielding to his temperament without
the trammels of a court. Holck frequently gave brilliant
luncheons at the Blaagard, a castellated building
outside the north gate, used at that time for all sorts
of festivities, and Christian took much pleasure in them.
At night, however, Holck accompanied the king on his
visits to Milady and back again, during which, street
riots were but too frequent.</p>

<p>It has been urged in apology for Holck, that he did
not really lead the king into these excesses, but could
not refrain from sharing in them, through fear of incurring
the king's displeasure. Moreover, he considered
his presence at these extravagances necessary, partly
because he at times succeeded in moderating the intended
outrages, partly because he was able to give the
people offended by the damage sustained a secret hint
that the doer of the mischief was his most sacred Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the King. Only in that way was it possible to
save the king from abuse, or even from personal violence.
Holck, it is further said, did the reckless young
king a real service, because, in the end, he induced him
to give up his connexion with the notorious Milady,
who had not only led the king into illicit amours, but
had also persuaded him to make nocturnal sallies in the
streets, to fight with the watchmen, and force his way
into low houses whose keepers had given her cause
of offence, to break glasses, bottles, and windows, and
commit similar acts of folly. In truth, it may have
appeared evident to Holck that such almost incredible
behaviour would eventually rob the king of all respect,
and expose him to the ridicule of the nation.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to bring before the reader
the lengthened <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chronique scandaleuse</i> which I have been
compelled to wade through. In giving what I have,
it was rather my purpose to offer a sketch of court life
a hundred years ago, as an introduction to an historical
drama which may seek its counterpart in vain in
the world's annals.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, space may be granted
to a small paragraph from the "Annual Register,"
which offers a further sign of the times:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Within the last few years a set of people have been
discovered in Denmark seized with a disorder of mind
which is extremely dangerous to society. This is an
imagination that by committing murder, and being afterwards
condemned to die for it, they are the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
able, by public marks of repentance and conversion as
they go to the scaffold, to prepare themselves for death,
and work out their own salvation. A little while ago
one of these wretches murdered a child out of the
same principle. In order, however, to take from these
wretches all hope of obtaining their end, and to extirpate
the evil, the king has issued an ordinance, by
which his Majesty forbids the punishing them with
death; and enacts, that they shall be branded in the
forehead with a hot iron and whipped; that they shall
afterwards be confined, for the rest of their days, in a
house of correction, in order to be kept there to hard
labour; and, lastly, that every year, on the day of their
crime, they shall be whipped anew in public."</p>

<p>In order to remove the bitter taste which the perusal
of the above paragraph has doubtless left in the mouth
of the reader, let me add another of a pleasanter
nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Another mark of paternal goodness of his Danish
Majesty to his subjects has appeared in the encouragement
and protection extended to the Society of Artists
lately established at Copenhagen, to which he has ordered
a yearly pension of 10,000 crowns, to be issued
from the royal treasury, to be applied in supporting
the necessitous, and in rewarding those who distinguish
themselves by their merit."</p>

<p>On January 28, 1768, the guns of the forts and fleets
of Seeland announced the birth of a son and heir to
Christian, in the future Frederick VI. The child was
sickly and feeble; but, for all that, the public would
not let themselves be robbed of an excuse for legitimate
rejoicing. As this auspicious event occurred on the
evening prior to the anniversary of the king's birthday,
there was a double festivity. All the foreign ministers
waited on the king to offer their felicitations; and two
days after, the little prince was christened; having as
sponsors Queen Juliana Maria, the hereditary prince,
and Frau von Berkentin, as proxy for the babe's ailing
great-aunt. The queen was attended day and night in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
turn by the grand mistress, a lady-in-waiting, and the
wife of a Knight of the Elephant; the royal babe by
two other ladies, according to rank; and this continued
until all the "court competent" ladies had shared the
privilege. That titles and orders should be distributed
on such an occasion, was but natural; but the influence
of Count Holck was remarkably displayed, through
the numerous marks of honour bestowed on nearly all
his relations.</p>

<p>If Juliana Maria had formed any ambitious plans,
the birth of the crown prince must have foiled them,
temporarily at least. The king's weak constitution,
the debauchery he indulged in in his youth, the perceptible
injury he had done his health, his dislike of
any employment, the slight respect his people displayed
toward him,&mdash;might have fostered, in the heart of this
far-sighted woman, a hope that either the throne or
the royal authority would pass to her son sooner or
later. This flattering hope was now dispelled, and with
it all the great expectations her ambition had fed on.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The administration still remained in the same hands
as before, with the exception of Count Danneskjold
Samsöe. This minister had been most unexpectedly
dismissed on October 26, 1767, having fallen a victim
to the intrigues of the two Russian envoys, Saldern
and Filosofow, who had a support in Bernstorff, because
with their assistance the latter had paved the way for
the exchange of the Gottorp portion of Holstein for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Soon
after, Bernstorff and Saldern succeeded in getting rid
of the second opponent of the Russian policy, General
St. Germain, to whom, on November 22, the king sent
the following note:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="p5"><span class="smcap">Mon cher Maréchal</span>,</p>

<p>Diverses raisons m'obligent à vous dispenser des
soins et des peines qui vous causent les affaires du
directoire. Vous auriez tort de regarder ceci comme
une disgrâce: Je désire que vous soyez persuadé de
la confiance avec la quelle je vous remettrais l'armée
s'il s'agissait de la conduire contre l'ennemi.</p>

<p class="center">Sur ce, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though the general was at liberty to go to court,
he did so but rarely, and was not particular in his
remarks: hence he received a second note, to the effect
that, as he did not seem pleased in Copenhagen, he
had better go and live elsewhere. By his own proposal,
he received, instead of his annual pay of 14,000
dollars, 60,000 thalers, paid once for all; but, as he
lost the money a year after by the failure of a Hamburg
house, the landgrave obtained him a pension of
4,000 dollars.</p>

<p>Bernstorff and Reventlow could now have come to
an understanding to share the power between them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but the latter was so incautious as to quarrel with his
old friend. The consequence was, that Bernstorff induced
the king, without any great difficulty, to deprive
Reventlow, for whom Christian had a well-founded
hatred, of his post, and recall his old opponent in his
place. On February 5, 1768, Reventlow was pensioned
off on 4,000 dollars, and Count Adam Gottlob
von Moltke took his former seat in the council of
state.</p>

<p>The dismissal of Reventlow was followed by that of
his nephew, Von Sperling, in which the king's new
favourite had a good deal to say. On the day of Reventlow's
retirement, Sperling was appointed bailiff of
Hütten, in Schleswig, retaining his former salary of
1,800 thalers, but with an order to proceed to his new
post at once. On the next day he quitted the capital,
and never appeared at court again. His uncle, however,
succeeded, by the aid of Baron von Schimmelmann,
in being recalled to the council of state a fortnight
after, where he was obliged to take his seat by
the side of his enemy, Moltke.</p>

<p>About this time the king displayed a remarkable
interest in the improvement of agriculture, which he
justly regarded as the surest and most natural source
of national prosperity. <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Motu proprio</i>, he issued a decree
on April 15, to appoint a "general commission
for agriculture," which would be dependent on himself.
Count Moltke was nominated president of this
commission; and though the old gentleman never regained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the power he had possessed under Frederick
V., still he became once more one of the most influential
men in the kingdom. Reventlow took proper notice
of this fact; and as he was experienced in court
intrigues, he effected a reconciliation with his opponent,
and employed his energies exclusively in securing
his regained power.</p>

<p>Satisfactory, to some extent, though this behaviour
on the part of the king was, his private life still continued
to be a scandal and offence. Before Reverdil
left Christian, he saw the faint traces of morality
he had striven to keep up, fade away. Motives of
public welfare, respect for individuals, the necessity of
being beloved and deserving the love, and even a
desire for glory, no longer worked on the king. So
soon as Reverdil's influence had expired with his absence,
the king indulged in worse extravagances than
before. Milady heightened his incipient mania by
the excesses into which she led him. He was seen
returning one morning, in broad daylight, from her
house in a state of intoxication. The people soon recognised
him, and pursued him with hootings and insults,
until the guards at the palace gates, by presenting
arms, offered a melancholy contrast with the preceding
scene. This woman led the king on the following
nights into the streets, accompanied by one or two
persons,&mdash;valets or disguised courtiers. They insulted
passers-by, and were thrashed several times. They
spent a whole night (Milady dressed as an officer,
Holck and a fourth person better disguised) in destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
some wretched hovels, when they threw the furniture
into the streets, after beating and driving out the
nymphs with their sword blades. The watch hurried
up to put a stop to it; but, on recognising the actors,
they restricted themselves to preventing the mob from
defending the oppressed. The crime of the inhabitants
of these impure "kips," was having spoken ill of
Milady, their rival.</p>

<p>The moment was at hand, however, when even
respectable persons would not dare take this liberty.
Milady induced her lover to buy her an hôtel, create
her a baroness, in short, grant her the same distinctions
as so many mistresses of his august predecessors
had enjoyed. The ministers, at length, resolved to
arrest her, and implored the assistance of Schimmelmann
and Saldern. The latter accompanied them to
the king, and forced from him an order to have her
removed. She was sent to Hamburg, where the obsequious
senate put her in prison. Eventually, Struensee
set her at liberty.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Inside the palace, the orgies were of a different
nature. The king took a delight in being beaten by
Count Holck; and it is said that the favourite carried
the correction to an extreme length, and thus obtained
presents for himself or appointments for his friends.
At other times, his Majesty, lying on the ground,
represented a criminal on the wheel; one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
favourites was the executioner, and counterfeited his
movements with a roll of paper. This amusement
filled Christian's mind with gloomy ideas, and augmented
his inclination for cruelty and melancholy.</p>

<p>The ministry was composed in the following way
after the changes already referred to:&mdash;Baron Reedz
Thott never interfered in any affairs of state but those
connected with his department; we have seen the
terms on which Reventlow and Moltke stood to each
other; and the fourth minister, Count Rosenkrantz,
though in his heart an enemy of Bernstorff, did not
dare to openly oppose the premier. Bernstorff had
two powerful supporters in the Gottorp envoy, Von
Saldern, and the Russian Filosofow, but was compelled
to buy their favour dearly, by giving his assent to all
their cabals. The following may serve as an example
of the omnipotence of these two gentlemen:&mdash;</p>

<p>When Count von Rantzau-Ascheberg, at that time
commander-in-chief in Norway, came on a journey into
the neighbourhood of Copenhagen, he was informed by
a court courier that he must remain a Danish mile
from the Residenz of the king. Page of the Chamber
Enevold Brandt was the deliverer of this order from
the royal cabinet. The hatred of the Russian ambassadors
against Rantzau was aroused by the circumstance
that he had taken part in the conspiracy against the life
of Peter III. As, however, he did not consider himself
properly rewarded by the new rulers in Petersburg,
he quitted Russia, and had become her most embittered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
foe. A letter of Saldern, quoted by Reverdil, will give
an excellent idea of the man:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This great trouble comes from the queen; she has
lost her right arm in Reventlow; she has still the left
in Plessen, a wicked woman, but I will also deprive
her of this arm. Sperling was her paid spy, and is a
thorough scoundrel. If he had but carried on his
trade with an honourable view! but it is only jealousy
of little Holck, who, in truth, is also a scoundrel, but
better at heart than Sperling. When the king goes to
the queen, she tells him he ought to be ashamed; the
whole town says that he lets himself be governed by
me. She only acts thus out of revenge, because I sent
away her flea-catcher. The king tells me all this, and
we laugh at it together.... Between ourselves,
Reventlow will soon be employed again, but in
some place where he can be useful. It was necessary
to humiliate him a little; had we not, we should not
have gained our ends. He is as fit for the post of
governor or for the finances as a donkey is to play the
organ."</p>

<p>A still further proof of Russian influence and Bernstorff's
servility was offered in February, 1768. Frau
von Plessen, the queen's first lady, though not standing
very high in the king's good graces, owing to her influence
over Caroline Matilda, still commanded his
respect, and he patiently endured her diatribes about
his licentious life. But Count Holck was her enemy,
because she had openly said that the count was only so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
obliging a court-marshal for the sake of retaining the
king's favour; and, in fact, she strove hard to remove
this dangerous young man from court. On the other
hand, Holck was no less desirous of getting rid of her
constant preaching and reproof. Still the count,
powerful though he was, did not succeed in overthrowing
Frau von Plessen, for she possessed the
queen's entire confidence and affection, and her Majesty
had a will of her own. At length, however, the
terrible Herr von Saldern came forward and interfered
in the cabal. Frau von Plessen, by Caroline Matilda's
instigation, urged the king to free himself from the
dangerous subjection in which Saldern held him, and
to treat him with greater dignity and decision; but
the king betrayed her to this man, whose pride was
deeply offended, and he did not rest till he obtained
Christian's promise to dismiss Frau von Plessen.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>On February 27, the king went to the palace of
Frederiksborg, five (Danish) miles from the capital,
and two days after his departure Frau von Plessen
received a royal order to quit the court at once, without
previously taking leave of the queen. In obedience to
the order, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande maîtresse</i> proceeded on the same
day to her estate of Kokkedal, situated on the Sound.
When the queen heard of the removal of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">>grande
maîtresse</i>, she opposed it, but all her objections were
unheeded, and she at length gave her consent, on condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
that Frau von Berkentin, the governess of Prince
Frederick, who entertained hopes of succeeding Frau
von Plessen, and had consequently mixed herself up
in the intrigue, should also be dismissed from court.</p>

<p>On the night of March 5, Frau von Berkentin received
orders to leave the Christiansborg Palace before
daybreak, and the capital within three days. Two
days after, Frau von Plessen was commanded to quit
the kingdom, and was not granted a pension. The
vacant post of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande maîtresse</i> was bestowed on the
wife of Privy Councillor von der Lühe, who did not
succeed, however, in gaining the affections of her royal
mistress, probably because she was the sister of the
detested Count Holck. For a long time past, the
queen had been very angry with the court-marshal as
the king's seducer, and this dislike was naturally
heightened when Holck played so prominent a part
in the dismissal of Frau von Plessen. To these causes
of dislike must be added that the young fop, puffed up
with pride and importance, at times went so far as to
forget the respect he owed the queen.</p>

<p>Count Holck's victory over Frau von Plessen was
further glorified by the king investing him with the
star of the Dannebrog order. With this intrigue ended
the ambassadorial career of the notorious Gottorp
envoy, Herr von Saldern. On March 13, 1768, he had
his farewell audience of the king. His career was a
curious one: he afterwards went as plenipotentiary to
Poland, where he rendered himself equally formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
by his imperious disposition. In that country, so says
Reverdil, he continued to receive bribes from all parties,
as he had always done. He was afterwards mixed up
in a conspiracy formed by the grand duchess of Russia
against the empress, her mother-in-law. The latter
took a noble revenge by dismissing him from her service.
He still remained a Knight of the Elephant, and
owner of two free estates in that very province of
Holstein where, as bailiff, he had been accused on
sufficient evidence of peculation, embezzlement, and
forgery. That Russia should select a Danish subject
who had been guilty of such offences as her envoy,
proves pretty clearly what respect was entertained for
Denmark by her powerful neighbour.</p>

<p>During Saldern's further short stay at Copenhagen,
he made himself remarkable by employing all his influence
to bring about the next episode in the life of
King Christian VII., which dealt a further blow to
the embarrassed finances.</p>

<p>During the reign of Frederick V., it had been proposed
that the crown prince should travel in foreign
countries, but the design was not carried out for various
reasons. It is very probable that the king's increasing
libertinism suggested to the advisers of the crown a
resumption of this plan, so as to withdraw Christian
from an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i>, who led him into incessant follies
and extravagance. It was Von Saldern who first discussed
this plan with Bernstorff, and when the other
ministers were consulted and reluctantly agreed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the king might be induced to live more reputably
through an acquaintance with other riders and courts,
Von Saldern and Bernstorff proposed to let him make
a tour through Germany, Holland, England, and
France. As, however, the ministers were afraid of the
king's propensities, they urged him to take with him
Count von Bernstorff to manage affairs, and in order
that money might not run short, they appointed Baron
von Schimmelmann treasurer for the journey.</p>

<p>This gentleman was a perfect type of the adventurer
of those days. He was a Saxon (according to others,
a native of Stettin), who had first been a lighterman
on the Elbe, conveying merchandise between Dresden
and Hamburg. Eventually, he set up in business on
his own account, and became bankrupt; after awhile
he managed to pay off his debts, and turned purveyor
to the Prussian armies, but, being afraid lest the King
of Prussia might learn what profits he had made, and
"squeeze" him, he retired to Altona. Denmark has
always given a hearty welcome to moneyed immigrants.
Schimmelmann, moreover, possessed financial ability,
and made himself useful in a moment of distress. He
made a deal of money out of government, and bought
two estates near Hamburg of the crown, and that of
Lindenburg, in Jütland, which was raised into a
barony. He spent the summer at Hamburg, with the
title of plenipo. to the states of Lower Saxony, and in
winter went to Copenhagen, where he dabbled in
financial operations. In addition to the title of Baron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
he had that of Grand Treasurer, and the ribbon of the
Dannebrog. He stood very well with the Russians,
who frequently made use of him.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>When the proposal to travel was laid before Christian,
he accepted it with delight, and Holck was no less
pleased at the opportunity of showing off. As Saldern
was unable to accompany the king, he contrived to
place in his suite, as a spy and confidential agent, a
Major Düring, who had passed from the service of
Russia into that of Christian, as aide-de-camp. Saldern's
real motive for urging the tour appears to have
been that, in this case, the King of Denmark could not
well avoid paying a visit to Petersburg, and complimenting
the empress on the ratification of the exchange.
This hope, however, was not realized.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Holck continued to revel in his
good fortune. He was betrothed to Fräulein von
Stockfleth, step-daughter of the bailiff of Aggerhuus,
although the young lady had not yet attained the legal
age for confirmation. The bridegroom's longing for
his young bride, or her fortune&mdash;which he very quickly
spent, by the way&mdash;was so great, however, that he
obtained an order from the king to the bishop of the
diocese, in which the latter was requested, himself, to
examine and confirm the young lady, and so soon as
this was done, her step-father brought the girl, who
was not fifteen years of age, to Copenhagen, in April,
for the purpose of being married to the count. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
menacing story was gathering on the favourite's
hitherto cloudless horizon.</p>

<p>Christian VII. found pleasure in the society of Page
of the Chamber <span class="smcap">Enevold Brandt</span>, as well as in that
of Count Conrad von Holck. This man, who plays a
principal part in the tragedy which will be presented
to the reader hereafter, was born at Copenhagen in
1738, and was consequently thirty years of age at this
time. His father was Conferenzrath Brandt, private
secretary and intendant of Queen Sophia Magdalena,
and his mother a daughter of Conferenzrath Berregaard.
The father died before his son's birth, and his
mother afterwards married Baron von Söhlenthal, administrator
of the county of Rantzau, in Holstein.
Young Brandt was brought up in his step-father's
house, and at an early age went to Copenhagen, in
order to attend the lectures of the celebrated jurisconsult
Kofod Ancher. In July 18, 1755, he was nominated
court page,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and afterwards studied at the noble
academy of Soroe, where he passed a brilliant examination
in law, on September 26, 1756. On May 12,
1759, he was appointed an <em>assessor auscultans</em> in the
Danish Chancery; on May 26, 1760, a page of the bed-chamber;
and on February 24, 1767, an assessor of the
supreme court. In September of the same year he
made a tour on the Continent, and on his return met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with a favourable reception at court. Brandt was
anything but good looking, and Falskenskjold describes
him to us as positively ugly. There was something repellent
in his face, which was pitted with small-pox, and
his physical constitution was as ruined as his morals.
Although he could not be denied talent, his behaviour
often rendered him ridiculous. Thus, for instance, he
was fond of singing in public, though he had a weak
voice; and he was equally fond of dancing, though he
cut a very awkward figure.</p>

<p>As page of the bed-chamber, Brandt took part in all
the court festivities. He was one of the performers in
<em>Zaire</em>, and was a good deal about the king's person;
but, like all the courtiers, he was eclipsed in the autocrat's
favour by Count Holck. Either through envy,
or because he really considered the count's conduct
worthy of blame, Brandt ventured to write, on May 2,
a letter of accusation to the king, in which he very
evidently displayed the intention of overthrowing the
favourite. In it, he first accused the favourite of
ingratitude; "for Count Holck leaves your Majesty
at all moments, in order to amuse himself on his own
account." Not long before, his Majesty had given up
a beloved object with forced resignation, and felt deep
sorrow at doing so.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He (Brandt) had hurried to
Schimmelmann and Holck, for the purpose of describing
to them his Majesty's great grief; which, however,
had not made the slightest impression on Holck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
although his Majesty frequently sacrificed his own
amusements for Holck's sake. Hardly three months
before, Holck had said to him (Brandt) that he was
terribly tired of the king, who constantly repeated the
same ideas; in short, his Majesty was unsupportable.
If Danneskjold came, the king yielded to his will, and
revoked what he had just sanctioned, and was so weak
as to allow the person who last spoke to him to be in
the right. Thus Holck had expressed himself to him
(Brandt), of whom he was in his heart afraid.</p>

<p>This was nothing, however, in comparison with the
contemptuous terms the count employed to others
about his Majesty. So long as the king remained in
his own country, a single moment would suffice to
reveal everything to his most gracious master, who
would say to himself: "This man was never devoted to
me: he only pursues his own pleasure, and wishes me
to sacrifice my name and money. Though I have
been so attached to this my favourite, yet he, whose
friendship and devotion I purchase with money, whose
relations I overwhelm with honours and lustre, and
whom I have raised to a position which no other man
ever reached at his age; yet this man, who pretends
to be faithfully attached to me, who assumes a character
which is beyond his abilities, has only served
me with feigned love and falsehood. He has employed
me to distinguish all his friends, and I have thus given
a public testimony of the power which he exercises
over me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Assuredly his Majesty, like so many other enlightened
persons, would have made such reflections;
and he (Brandt) would have awaited their result, had
his most gracious king remained in Denmark. But
now the moment had arrived to ring the alarm bell,
for the king, in his impending tour, would certainly
present Count von Holck to all the nations of Europe
as the most distinguished man in Denmark, and as
connected with the king by a close friendship. But
then the favourite would be put on his trial; he would
be judged; and what an opinion would be entertained
about his Majesty! The point now was not a sacrifice
to be made, but solely to regard matters as they really
were. He (Brandt) implored his Majesty not to
punish Holck for his audacity. Equally incapable of
thinking as of blushing at his bad thoughts, Holck
would seek a support in his worthlessness. "But,
dearest, best of kings," Brandt concluded his charge,
"be free, and do not stake your own respect before
the greatest part of Europe! Your star announces to
you the admiration of the whole world: my predictions
will be fulfilled, for my head gives me the most varied
assurances of it; and, I may add, that my heart gives
me still sweeter ones."</p>

<p>This wretched twaddle, which Suhm has before me
quoted as a moderate proof of the mental qualities of
the usually so talented Brandt, may serve here as a
specimen of the cabals and miserable intrigues that
went on at the Danish court in the reign of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
VII. When the king had informed his favourite
of the contents of Brandt's letter, Count Holck's papa-in-law
attempted a defence in an equally worthless
parody of the denunciation, which he handed to the
king. In this we find as conclusion, that Count Holck
was a young man, according to the laws of nature
given to pleasure; but he had never appealed to the
king's privy purse to defray his expenses. He had,
on many occasions, aided most zealously in executing
his commissions. Brandt, however, had offended
against the duties of gratitude, friendship, and virtue;
and the king's sharp eye would be able to estimate
this black conduct at its true value. Brandt had assailed
his friend, but the weapons which he employed
had turned against himself, for he had called in question
his Majesty's power of judgment. Still, it would
become his Majesty to forgive the offence, for Brandt's
moderate abilities must serve as his excuse.</p>

<p>It is true that Brandt had as many powerful friends
at court as Hoick had enemies, for even Caroline
Matilda was regarded as his protectress. But the
ministers were on Holck's side, and hence he succeeded
in retaining his master's favour. On May 4, just as
Brandt was leaving the Supreme Court, a letter written
in French, and signed by the king, was handed to him.
It was to the effect, that the atrocious conduct of which
he had been guilty, the step he had dared to take,
and the object of which was plain to everybody, naturally
drew down on him the king's deepest contempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
His Majesty, therefore, ordered him to quit the capital
within twenty-four hours, and the states of the realm
in eight days, under penalty of the severest displeasure
if he dared ever to return. The next day
Brandt left Copenhagen in a melancholy mood, for he
had spent his own fortune in Paris, and his step-father,
Von Söhlenthal, had just died.</p>

<p>On the day after this court interlude King Christian
quitted the capital, in order to commence his travels
in foreign parts. The queen had desired to accompany
him, but this was refused her, and she wept
bitterly when he took leave of her. In Frau von
Plessen she had lost a maternal friend, and in Frau
von der Lühe, who took her place, she only saw a
guardian and spy. Hence it is not surprising that
Caroline Matilda acted on the wise resolution of living
in the strictest retirement during her husband's absence.
How could she, a girl of seventeen, sympathise
with the ladies who graced or disgraced the court
at that day? Among these were, in addition to Frau
von der Lühe and the maid of honour, Von Eyben,
Frau von Gähler, the Baroness von Bülow, the Melleville,
and a number of other ladies, none of whom,
however, had an unsullied reputation, but all their
cavaliers and adorers.</p>

<p>The suite accompanying the king when he left
Copenhagen consisted of no less than fifty-six persons,
among them being Von Bernstorff, the premier, the
supreme Court-Marshal Frederick von Moltke, Court-Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Count Holck, and many other gentlemen of
position. From Korsöer the party sailed across the
Great Belt to the island of Fühnen, where the king
met his ex-valet Kirchhoff, who, on his dismissal from
court, had been appointed customs inspector at
Nyborg, and to whom Christian gave the title of
Councillor of Justice, in his delight at seeing a face
he knew. From here the journey was continued
through the islands, Jütland and Schleswig to
Gottorp, where the king paid a visit to the Dowager
Margravine of Brandenburg Kulmbach,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> widow of
the late viceroy, as whose successor the king had
nominated Landgrave Charles, his brother-in-law,
prior to leaving Copenhagen. Here he remained till
May 28. At the village of Bau, before Flensburg,
the two Russian envoys, Von Saldern and Filosofow,
received the king, and accompanied him to the city
of Schleswig, where numerous festivities took place in
honour of the exalted guest, while diplomatic affairs
were being discussed which grew into such importance
for Denmark.</p>

<p>When Christian VII. ascended the throne the entire
kingdom was oppressed by heavy debts, entailed by
the impending war with Russia, in 1762, about the
duchies, and by the extravagance of the two last kings.
Reventlow, as first deputy of the College of Finances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
strove gradually to liquidate these debts, and at first
met with some success, partly by raising a new tax,
partly by employing the &pound;100,000 which the British
parliament granted Caroline Matilda as dower. On
the other hand, however, the burial of Frederick V.,
and the marriage of the princesses, had entailed great
expenses on the royal treasury. Notwithstanding
that the country had been spared the customary princess
tax, raised on the marriage of princesses belonging
to the royal family, there was a great difficulty
in raising the funds for the royal tour. At first
64,000 species a month were granted for it, but this
sum was not nearly sufficient for the numerous suite,
and it came out eventually that more than thrice the
amount was expended monthly. Hence an addition
of 20,000 thalers a month was demanded from Copenhagen,
and the deficiency was covered by the excessively
wealthy Baron von Schimmelmann, who
made a temporary advance of 400,000 species, and
afterwards paid a similar amount for presents made
by the king abroad, taking as security the import dues
of the kingdom of Norway. If we add to this sum
the king's private outlay, we may, without fear of exaggeration,
assume the total expenditure on the tour
at one million and a half of dollars, or &pound;225,000,
which the indebted states of Denmark had to pay
for the unsuccessful attempt to improve the king's
morals.</p>

<p>In Schleswig, the king's suite was slightly reduced,
as the chief page, Von der Lühe, Count Gustavus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
von Holck, and the physician in ordinary, Etats-rath von
Berger, returned hence to Copenhagen. On May 29,
the king, accompanied by the two Russian envoys,
proceeded to Kiel, where the Prince-Bishop of Lübeck
paid his respects to him, and Von Saldern took leave
for the very last time. In order to give this important
Gottorp minister a proof of his special satisfaction for
the zeal which he had displayed in the exchange, the
king raised him and his son here to the rank of count,
under the name of Saldern Gunderoth. Bernstorff
also received the same honour.</p>

<p>I have said so much about this exchange and yet
so little, that I will venture on one political paragraph,
especially as the matter crops up every now and then
in the papers. Charles Frederick, sovereign duke of
Holstein Gottorp, threw in his fortunes with those of
Charles XII. of Sweden, his relation, and shared his
disasters. Frederick IV., king of Denmark, robbed
him of a portion of his states, and had himself recognised
as legitimate owner of them in the treaty which
he concluded, in 1720, with Sweden; but the Duke of
Holstein protested against that portion of the treaty
which despoiled him; and though that prince was at
the time very feeble, the King of Denmark in vain
offered him a million of crowns to give up his rights.
The house of Holstein-Gottorp eventually acquired
a formidable power in the north: a younger branch
ascended the Swedish throne, and the head of the
elder branch became Emperor of Russia, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
title of Peter III., in 1762. Peter made a claim to
his hereditary states, and was preparing to enforce it,
when he was got rid of, and Catharine, his successor,
agreed to an amicable settlement of the affair by an
exchange.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why Russia gave up so
magnificent a chance of founding a maritime power as
she would have had by the possession of Holstein. So
long as she held it, it would have been a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête du pont</i>
by which to enter Germany, and she would not have
failed to exercise a predominant influence in Denmark.
There is reason for believing that Saldern caused
Christian VII. to be regarded as a member of the
reigning house of Russia who must be treated generously;
so that, feeling himself under the beneficent
influence of the imperial family to which he belonged
by blood, he might become entirely devoted to it.
In any case, the treaty by which Russia exchanged her
claims on ducal Schleswig and Holstein for the counties
of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, which were intended
to form an appanage for a junior branch of
the Holstein family, was signed in 1768.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>From Kiel the king went, on the following day, to
Traventhal Castle, and thence to Ahrensburg, near
Hamburg, where <span class="smcap">John Frederick Struensee</span>, hitherto
physician of Altona, and of the lordship of Pinneberg,
was appointed surgeon in ordinary, and joined the
king's suite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>On June 6, Christian VII. left his own states and
sailed across the Elbe at Zollenspicker, under the incognito
of Count von Traventhal. His reputation preceded
him.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In consequence of Voltaire's well-known
defence of Jean Calas, King Christian had sent the
poet, through Reverdil, a handsome sum of money for
the family of the victim of French justice, and their
renowned protector had sung the praises of the benefactor
in a poem which "went the round" of the press.
It was stated in it that King Christian sought unhappy
persons in foreign parts because there were none such
in his own country.</p>

<p>It might really be believed that there were no poor
in Denmark, when we notice the abundant proofs of
charity and special favour which the King of the Danes
everywhere left behind him during his tour in foreign
parts. Still, it was neither these presents nor the lustre
of the throne that produced a pleasant impression on
foreigners; it was, on the contrary, the king's personal
appearance. At this period Christian seemed to have
shaken off his natural gloom, and was remarkably witty;
at the same time, he was extremely gallant and easy in
his manners. Travelling evidently had its ordinary
effect on him, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>While his suite were sent on to Amsterdam <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">viâ</i> Osnabrück<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and Münster, the king resolved to make a détour
to Hanau with Bernstorff and Holck, and surprise
his brother-in-law, Landgrave Charles, whom he had
recently appointed viceroy of the duchies, and his own
dearly-beloved sister Louise, who had just given birth
to a daughter, afterwards known as the lovely Maria,
Queen of Denmark, wife of Frederick VI. Landgrave
Charles, though greatly surprised at the visit, gave the
king a hearty welcome; and they all went to Philipsruhe,
where Christian spent a week in feasting, dancing, and
all sorts of amusement. With his natural expansiveness,
the king blurted out to his brother-in-law all he
had on his heart. At the first town ball Christian sate
down by his side, and said to him: "Listen to me, my
dear prince, I have something to say to you. You will
hear all sorts of things that have been said about you;
I must tell you candidly I was angry with you at that
time, I really do not know why, and so I told a frightful
lot of falsehoods about you to everybody; but you must
not take any notice of them, for I am now very fond of
you again." The prince, while thanking his brother-in-law
for this confidence, naturally asked, "But how
was it possible that you, who knew me so well, could
act thus toward me?" to which the king replied, "Oh!
I do not know; but I was very savage with you."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>From Hanau the king went through Frankfort to
Mainz, sailed on the following day in a yacht down the
Rhine to Coblenz, visited Ehrenbreitstein and Rheinfels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and travelled on land from Bonn to Cologne and
Wesel. After staying two days in the latter town, he
accepted an invitation from the Hereditary Stadtholder,
the Prince of Orange, to St. Loo, and thence went
straight to Amsterdam, where he rejoined his suite.</p>

<p>The king remained six days in Amsterdam, thirteen
at the Hague, and ten at Brussels, being everywhere received
by an enormous crowd, and honoured by grand
banquets, for which he evinced his gratitude by costly
presents.</p>

<p>From Brussels the journey was continued <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">viâ</i> Ghent,
Bruges, and Ostend, to Dunkirk, from which town
the Princes of Croy and Robecq accompanied the king
to Calais. Here Captain Campbell was awaiting the
brother-in-law of George III. with the <em>Mary</em> yacht,
and he landed safely at Dover late on the evening of
August 10. His Danish Majesty, we read, was saluted
by the cannon of the castle, forts, and vessels of the
harbour, and was received with every possible mark of
distinction and respect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="p1">CHRISTIAN IN ENGLAND.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>GEORGE III.&mdash;THE JOURNEY TO TOWN&mdash;THE STABLE YARD&mdash;HORACE
WALPOLE&mdash;THE FIRST MEETING OF THE KINGS&mdash;THE
PRINCESS OF WALES&mdash;FESTIVITIES&mdash;CHRISTIAN MADE A D.C.L.&mdash;THE
CITY BANQUET&mdash;THE BILL OF FARE&mdash;THE BALL IN THE
HAYMARKET&mdash;CHRISTIAN TAKES LEAVE&mdash;ANECDOTES.</p></blockquote>


<p>The visit of Christian VII. to England was not particularly
agreeable to George III. The English monarch,
who had no taste for show and amusement,
tried to get off under pretext of the national confusions;
but Christian, who, as Walpole says, had both
the obstinacy and caprices of youth, had persisted, and
came to England as a very unwelcome guest.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, too, but that George III. had
been apprised of his sister's critical and unhappy situation,
of Mariana Julia's treatment of her, and of the
king's culpable neglect and forbearance.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Moreover,
Christian's licentious conduct, both at home and abroad,
was necessarily a horror to so good a man as his brother-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Add to this, that the king of England
had recently suffered a severe domestic affliction in the
death of his second sister, H.R.H. Louisa Anne, and we
shall not feel surprised that he was unable to dissimulate
his feelings toward his royal guest.</p>

<p>At the outset, a marked discourtesy was shown
Christian; no royal carriages were in waiting at Dover
to receive him, and he had to come to town in hired
coaches. Walpole explains in this way. "Somehow or
another, the Master of the Horse happened to be in
Lincolnshire, and the king's horses having received
no orders, were too good subjects to go and fetch a
stranger king of their own heads. However, as his
Danish Majesty travels to improve himself for the good
of his people, he will go back extremely enlightened in
the arts of government and morality, by having learned
that crowned heads may be reduced to ride in hackney
coaches." The official excuse for this neglect was, that
Christian was so impatient to see the famed metropolis
of Great Britain, that he declined the sumptuous state
coaches, and travelled in a post-chaise.</p>

<p>Hearing that the clergy and corporation of Canterbury
and Rochester intended to receive him with all
possible pomp, the king was almost thrown into a passion,
as he detested formalities of any sort, and was
disposed to consider the clergy, as a body, with profligate
contempt. He said to Count Bernstorff: "The
last King of Denmark who entered Canterbury laid
that city in ashes, and massacred its inhabitants. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to Heaven they had recollected this, and let me pass
quietly through their venerable town, where our ancestors
committed so many crimes!" The count told Christian,
with a smile, that the good citizens of Canterbury
would find less difficulty in forgetting the outrages
suffered by their forefathers, than in being deprived of
the honour of making a speech and kissing his royal
hand.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The only mark of attention shown Christian by his
brother-in-law, was in re-furnishing his suite of rooms
in the Stable Yard of St. James's Palace, at an expense
of &pound;3,000. When Count Holck first saw the palace,
he exclaimed: "By God, this will never do; it is not
fit to lodge a Christian in." According to the official
report of the "Annual Register," the royal suite consisted
of,&mdash;Count von Bernstorff, his principal secretary
of state; Baron von Schimmelmann, treasurer;
Count von Moltke, grand marshal; Count von Holck,
grand master of the wardrobe; Baron von Bülow, one
of the lords of the bed-chamber; Mr. Schumacher, councillor
of conferences, private secretary; Baron von
Düring, aide-de-camp; MM. Temmler and Sturtz,
councillors of embassy of the foreign office; Dr. Struensee,
physician; and several officers and servants.</p>

<p>So soon as Christian arrived in London he was
waited on by the Earl of Hertford and Lord Falmouth,
who complimented him on his arrival. George III.,
however, displayed no <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">empressement</i> to greet his guest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
on the contrary, he behaved with a sullenness which,
though it might be justifiable, was certainly impolitic,
considering the connection between France and Denmark,
which England considered as of such vital importance
to break off. As usual, Horace Walpole the
indefatigable supplies the best account of this fresh
piece of scandal:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By another mistake, King George happened to go
to Richmond about an hour before King Christian arrived
in London. An hour is exceedingly long, and
the distance to Richmond still longer; so, with all the
despatch which could possibly be made, King George
could not get to his capital till next day at noon.
Then, as the road from his closet at St. James's, to
the King of Denmark's apartments on the other side of
the palace, is about thirty miles (which posterity, having
no conceptions of the prodigious extent and magnificence
of St. James's, will never believe), it was
half an hour after three before his Danish Majesty's
cousin could go and return to let him know that his
good brother and ally was leaving the palace (in which
they both were) to receive him at the queen's palace,
which, you know, is about a million of snail's paces
from St. James's. Notwithstanding these difficulties
and unavoidable delays, Woden, Thor, Frigga, and all
the gods that watch over the kings of the north, did
bring these two invincible monarchs to each other's
embraces about half an hour after four on the same
evening. They passed an hour in projecting a royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
compact, that will regulate the destiny of Europe to
latest posterity; and then, the fates so willing it, the
British prince departed for Richmond, and the Danish
potentate repaired to the widowed mansion of his royal
mother-in-law, where he poured forth the fulness of
his heart in praises of the lovely bride she had bestowed
upon him, from whom nothing but the benefit of his
subjects would have torn him." Another passage
from the same letter is in Horace's finest vein of sarcasm:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And here let calumny blush, who has aspersed so
chaste and faithful a monarch with low amours; pretending
that he has raised to a seat in his sublime
council an artisan of Hamburg, known only by repairing
the soles of buskins, because that mechanic would
on no other terms consent to his fair daughter's being
honoured with majestic embraces.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> So victorious over
his passions is this Scipio from the pole, that though
on Shooter's Hill he fell into an ambuscade, laid for
him by an illustrious countess, of blood royal herself,
his Majesty, after descending from his car and courteously
greeting her, again mounted his vehicle, without
being one moment eclipsed from the eyes of the surrounding
multitude."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The princess dowager so overwhelmed Christian
with inquiries about her daughter, that her wearied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
son-in-law could not refrain from whispering to his
favourite, Holck: "Cette chère maman m'embête
terriblement." Finally, when she begged Christian
to restore Frau von Plessen to the post of grande maîtresse,
the king replied, that he would not oppose it,
but would leave the court himself, as he was resolved
never to live under the same roof with Frau von Plessen
again. After leaving the Princess of Wales, the royal
party attended Lady Hertford's assembly. Walpole,
who was present, says: "He only takes the title of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Altesse</i> (an absurd mezzo termine), but acts king accordingly,
struts in the circle like a cock sparrow, and
does the honours of himself very civilly." But the
thing that seems to have struck Walpole most, was the
subserviency of Christian's ministers and attendants,
who (as we shall see presently) bowed as low to him at
every word as if he were a Sultan Amurath. Severest
are his strictures on Bernstorff, of whom he says: "A
grave old man, running round Europe after a chit, for
the sake of domineering over a parcel of beggar Danes,
when he himself is a Hanoverian, and might live at
ease on an estate he has at Mecklenburg."</p>

<p>On the 19th, the king had a heavy day of it, visiting
Westminster Abbey, the Tower, the Armoury, the
Bank, the Mint, and St. Paul's Cathedral, where he
ascended to the golden gallery. On the same evening,
H.R.H. the Princess Amelia entertained the King
of Denmark, the Duke of Gloucester, and upwards of
three hundred of the nobility, with a grand supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
after which was a ball,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> at Gunnersbury House. The
supper consisted of one hundred and twenty dishes; a
grand firework was played off; and the ball, which
was very splendid, ended at about three o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
The beautiful Lady Talbot, who was supposed to have
made a great impression on Christian's susceptible
heart, wore at this ball a diamond coronet which was
estimated to be worth &pound;80,000. It appears, from Walpole,
that the Princess Amelia felt hurt at the treatment
of her nephew, and determined to mark her sense
of it by this entertainment. The king and the princess
dowager were then, in courtesy, obliged to follow her
example; but, to show how much they disliked the
precedent, they left the Princess Amelia out of their
entertainments. The King of England, however, did
not behave so badly to his brother-in-law after all.
He paid for his table at the rate of &pound;84 a day, without
wines,&mdash;and that bill, we may be sure, was a heavy
one,&mdash;and supplied his sideboard with the original
plate of Henry VIII., which was always deposited in
the jewel office in the Tower, and never made use of
but at a coronation. Though George disliked the
man, he respected the king.</p>

<p>Walpole gives us a graphic account of Christian at
this time, in a letter to George Montagu:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I came to town to see the Danish king. He is as
diminutive as if he came out of a kernel in the fairy
tales. He is not ill made, nor weakly made, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
so small; and though his face is pale and delicate, it
is not at all ugly. Still, he has more royalty than folly
in his air; and considering he is not hearty, is as well
as any one expects a king in a puppet-show to be."</p>

<p>A few days after, Horace appears to have modified
his opinion. I wonder whether the corns of his self-esteem
had been trodden on in the interim?</p>

<p>"Well then, this great king is a very little one.
He has the sublime strut of his grandfather (or a
cock-sparrow), and the divine white eyes of all his
family on the mother's side. His curiosity seems to
have consisted in the original plan of travelling, for I
cannot say he takes notice of anything in particular.
The mob adore and huzza him, and so they did at the
first instant. They now begin to know why, for he
flings money to them out of the window; and by the
end of the week, I do not doubt they will want to
choose him for Middlesex. His court is extremely
well ordered, for they bow as low to him at every word
as if his name were Sultan Amurath. You would take
his first minister for only the first of his slaves. I hope
this example, which they have been good enough to exhibit
at the Opera, will civilize us. There is, indeed, a
pert young gentleman who a little discomposes this
august ceremonial; his name is Count Holck; his age,
three-and-twenty; and his post answers to one that we
had formerly in England ages ago, called in our tongue,
a royal favourite."</p>

<p>On August 30, his Majesty arrived at Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> for York races. The vice-chancellor at once waited on the
king with the heads of houses, and "showed him the elephant." After
walking wearily through the town and its sights, Christian got off by
inviting the vice-chancellor to supper. He arrived at York the next day
with a retinue of one hundred and twenty persons, and shirked a grand
entertainment which the mayor and corporation insisted on giving him.
He returned to London <em>viâ</em> Manchester, where "he was particularly
gratified by viewing the stupendous works of the Duke of Bridgewater,
at which he expressed both astonishment and pleasure."</p>

<p>On September 4, Christian returned to town, after performing the
great feat of travelling nearly six hundred miles in seven days. On
September 8, we find him, after the Opera, going to take a view of the
house of Mrs. Cornelis, in Soho Square, of which Casanova gives us such
fragrant details. The rooms had been got up "regardless of expense,"
more than two thousand wax candles being lighted; and the king opened
the ball with the Duchess of Lancaster. Among the persons present, I
notice the Russian General Filosofow, but am unable to discover what
had brought that arch-intriguer to England.</p>

<p>On September 12, a magnificent entertainment was given Christian at
Sion House, by the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland. The account of
the festivities reminds us of the later days of Vauxhall, for there
were fifteen thousand coloured lamps; and the temple erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in the inner court was ornamented with transparent paintings that had
a very happy effect. Among the company were their royal highnesses the
Princess Amelia and the Dukes of Gloucester and Cumberland.</p>

<p>On September 17, Christian arrived in Oxford with the principal
members of his suite, and was received in great pomp by Dr. Durell,
the vice-chancellor. After seeing all the sights, he was taken to the
theatre, where, in full convocation, the king had the honorary degree
of D.C.L. conferred upon him. The same honour befell Bernstorff,
Schimmelmann, Holck, Düring, and Bülow, while Struensee had the
honorary degree of Doctor of Physic conferred upon him, being the
second foreigner to whom this honour had been granted. I wonder how
much Christian understood of the elegant Latin speech in which Dr.
Vansittart, Regius Professor of Law, presented him? From Oxford,
Christian visited Ditchley Park, Blenheim, Buckingham, and Stow; and we
can quite agree with the polite writer in the "Annual Register," who
says: "His journeyings are so rapid, and his stay at places so short,
that if he is not a youth of more than common talents, he must have a
very confused idea of what he sees." Horace Walpole, writing to Sir H.
Mann, under date September 22, speaks very severely on this head, but,
I am afraid, with more justice than usual:</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing but what you know already
about the King of Denmark hurrying from one corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of England to the other, without seeing anything distinctly, fatiguing
himself, breaking his chaise, going tired to bed in inns, and getting
up to show himself to the mob at the window. I believe that he is a
very silly lad; but the mob adore him, though he has neither done
nor said anything worth repeating; but he gives them an opportunity
of getting together, of staring, and of making foolish observations.
Then the news papers talk their own language, and call him <em>a great
personage</em>; and a great personage that comes so often in their way
seems almost one of themselves raised to the throne. At the play of the
<cite>Provoked Wife</cite>, he clapped whenever there was a sentence
against matrimony,&mdash;a very civil proceeding when his wife is an
English princess!"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th, a very grand entertainment was given by their Majesties
to the King of Denmark at the queen's house, at which the Princess
Dowager of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester, and a great number of the
nobility, were present. Covers were laid for one hundred and seventy;
and after the entertainment there was a ball, which Christian opened at
nine o'clock with the queen; after which, George III. walked a minuet
with the Duchess of Ancaster. The King of Denmark, who always kept it
up to the last, did not retire till half-past four in the morning.</p>

<p>But the grandest affair of all was the dinner given to Christian by
the City. The lord mayor and aldermen proceeded in their state barges
to fetch the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
from the Stairs, at New Palace Yard, and conveyed him to Temple Stairs,
where he landed, and took some refreshments offered by the Benchers.
Judging from an engraving in the "Gentleman's Magazine," the scene
on the river must have been very gay; and in those days, when the
Thames still possessed some claim to the epithet of silvery, the king
doubtless enjoyed the animated scene.</p>

<p>From the Temple, the king proceeded in the City state coach to
the Mansion House, preceded by the Honourable Artillery Company, and
the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, the freedom of which Christian
had deigned to accept. On arrival, there was the inevitable address
read by Mr. Recorder, from which it is worth while to extract one
passage, which seems to show that the force of lying could no further
go:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The many endearing ties which happily connect you, sir, with
our most gracious sovereign, justly entitle you to the respect and
veneration of all his Majesty's faithful subjects; but your affability
and other princely virtues, so eminently displayed during the whole
course of your residence among us, have, in a particular manner,
charmed the citizens of London, who reflect with admiration on your
early and uncommon thirst of knowledge, and your indefatigable pursuit
of it by travel and observation; the happy fruits of which, they doubt
not, will be long employed, and acknowledged within the whole extent of
your influence and command."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian&mdash;I hope blushing as he did so&mdash;returned a most
polite answer in Danish, and then, no doubt, was very glad to hear
dinner announced. In the Egyptian Gallery, we read, that "His Majesty
condescended to walk quite round, so that the ladies (who made a most
brilliant appearance in the galleries) might have a full view of his
royal person: and all the gentlemen of the common council below an
opportunity of personally paying him their respects." Surely this was a
heavy price to pay even for a lord mayor's feed!</p>

<p>As history&mdash;at any rate since Macaulay's
example&mdash;condescends, like the elephant's trunk, to take notice of
the smallest things, I may be forgiven for quoting here the <em>menu</em> of
the remarkable dinner which took place in honour of the occasion, which
has been duly enshrined in the "Annual Register":&mdash;</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, after the usual loyal toasts, and taking tea and
coffee in the great parlour, his Majesty and retinue took coach, and
returned to St. James's Palace amid the same crowd and acclamations,
with the addition of illuminations in almost every window, so that
the people might have the pleasure of seeing his Majesty as much as
possible.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the poor king, who could hardly have digested the good
things of which I have just given a list, was entertained at Richmond
Lodge, by order of his Majesty King George. Some attempt at taste
seems to have been made on this occasion, for we read of a splendid
temple with festoons of flowers and emblematical pictures alluding to
the arts and sciences. The fireworks were the finest ever exhibited,
and "their Majesties and the nobility present were pleased to express
their entire satisfaction." The whole road from London to the Lodge was
illuminated by upwards of fifteen thousand Italian lamps, from three in
the afternoon till the next morning.</p>

<p>On October 1, the Princess of Wales gave a grand entertainment at
Carlton House in honour of Christian. It consisted of three tables, one
for their Majesties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and the Princess Dowager of Wales; a second for the King of Denmark:
and fifty of the nobility; and the third for H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales and his attendants, &amp;c. The princess dowager and the King of
Denmark had not got on at all well together, and he entirely lost her
good graces by the following piece of impertinence. The princess was
amusing herself one day with a lady of her court, to whom the King of
Denmark had presented a superb set of jewels, with telling fortunes
by the cards, and Christian said to her, "My dear mother, how do you
designate my Majesty in your pasteboard court?" "Lady &mdash;&mdash;,"
said the princess with an arch smile, "calls you the King of Diamonds."
"And what do you call Holck?" Christian continued. "Oh, by a title far
more flattering; that rake is called the King of Hearts." "Then pray,
my dear mamma," said Christian, piqued by her ironical allusions,
"under which of the suits do you designate Lord Bute?" This repartee,
severe as it was unexpected, crimsoned the face of the princess, who
rallied soon after, evidently offended with her incorrigible son-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>While Christian was at Newmarket races, a deputation arrived from
Cambridge, begging him and his suite to accept the same degrees from
that university as from Oxford. On October 10, Christian gave a superb
masked ball at the Opera House in the Haymarket, at which no less than
two thousand five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of the nobility and gentry were present. Even staid George III.
could not resist the temptation, but remained in a private box with
transparent shutters. The Princess Amelia also sat the whole time in
one of the boxes, masked. Christian opened the ball with the Duchess
of Ancaster, and any one who wishes to know what characters were
represented, I can refer to the "Gentleman's Magazine," which contains
an engraving of the ball. There was an awful squeeze and a magnificent
supper, and the value of the jewels worn on this occasion amounted to
upwards of &pound;2,000,000. Still, the company must have been rather
mixed, for a noble duke lost his snuff-box, on which was a portrait
of the King of France, set with brilliants. The ball cost Christian
&pound;3,000.</p>

<p>On the 11th, Christian held a levee at St. James's, when the
nobility took leave of him, and on the following day he bade farewell
to the royal family. On the evening before his departure, the king
made a present to the Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain, and to
Lord Talbot, Lord Steward, of a ring each, valued at &pound;1,500,
and left 1,000 guineas to be distributed among the domestics of the
king's palace. The Earl of Holderness, Constable of Dover Castle, was
appointed to attend his Majesty until his embarkation. As a pleasing
relief to this royal extravagance, we read that just before Christian's
departure, Garrick had the honour of an interview, when the king gave
him a very elegant gold box studded with diamonds, begging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
him to receive it as a small mark of the regard he had for his
extraordinary talents.</p>

<p>On October 13, Christian went up the Medway to Chatham in the
Victory, man-of-war, and inspected the British fleet. Chance decreed
that the young officer who commanded the ship was the same Gambier
who, in 1807, as Admiral of the Blue, commanded the English fleet
with thirty thousand men aboard, who landed in Zealand, carried off
the Danish fleet, plundered the arsenals, and laid one-seventh of
Copenhagen in ashes.</p>

<p>On October 14, the king again went on board the Mary yacht at Dover,
which was to convey him to Calais. Just as he was escaping, a parting
shot was fired at him by an officer on board, in the shape of the most
execrable and mendacious verses ever written, and that is saying a good
deal. For that reason I shall quote them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

</div>

<p>The king certainly had no cause to complain of the honours and
distinctions granted him in London. Artists and sculptors strove to
immortalize his memory, and engravings of him might be seen in all the
windows. But the ladies of the nobility were the most enthusiastic
about the "northern scamp," as the lovely Lady Talbot christened the
youthful King of Denmark, and in memory of whom they brought into
fashion a head-dress which was christened the "Denmark Fly."</p>

<p>So far we have dealt with the king's public appearance in England.
His private amusements, unfortunately, continued of the same scandalous
nature as in Copenhagen. Night after night he and Holck passed in
the most disgusting debauchery, and these rambles were generally
commenced after midnight. The king opened the ball at Sion House with
his sister-in-law, the Queen of Great Britain; he danced with the
Princess of Saxe-Gotha and the Duchess of Ancaster; and, within an
hour after quitting these scenes of royal grandeur, he would throw off
his gorgeous dress, disguise himself as a sailor, and haunt the lowest
purlieus of St. Giles's. A volume might easily be filled with<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the frolics and extravagances committed while in England by this
dissipated youth, and those servile courtiers, who, to gratify the
sovereign, flattered every folly, and sought with lamentable avidity,
even in the paths of infamy and vice, the means of making themselves
agreeable or useful.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, some anecdotes have been preserved, which, while
bearing testimony to the king's profuse extravagance, throw a little
more agreeable light upon his character. It is true, that he gave
without discrimination, and acted on the impulse of the moment; but it
is equally true that, whenever he saw an object of real distress, his
hand went spontaneously to his pocket, and if that chanced to be empty,
his ring, watch, or any other valuables about him, was bestowed instead
of money.</p>

<p>The King of Denmark, on one occasion, saw a poor tradesman put into
a hackney-coach by two bailiffs, followed by his weeping wife and
family, from whom he was about to be torn, and thrown into prison. He
ordered Count Moltke to follow the coach to the Marshalsea. He paid the
debt and costs; and, setting the poor man free from every other demand,
gave him 500 dollars to enable him to begin the world anew; and, on
several other occasions he distributed considerable sums among the poor
debtors confined in the different gaols of the metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>A ludicrous adventure into which the king was led by his mania
for going about <em>incog.</em> is preserved for us by the author of
"Northern Courts." For a better supply of his wants, the king
had caused an unlimited credit to be opened with a very rich but
penurious City merchant, under the name of Mr. Frederikson. Dressed
as private gentlemen, the king and Count Holck went to the merchant's
counting-house, and took up &pound;4,000. The merchant, very desirous
of knowing more of such good customers, employed a lad to watch them.
Seeing the strangers enter the palace of St. James's by a private
door, he inquired of a sentry who they were, and was told that they
must belong to the King of Denmark's suite, as no other persons were
allowed to enter that way. On telling this to his master, the latter
was delighted at the prospect of thus making a handsome profit; while
his wife, equally bent on obtaining through them a view of the King
of Denmark, or at least of his apartments, suggested the propriety of
inviting them to tea, on their next visit.</p>

<p>This civility was really offered on the next occasion that the king
wanted money. The merchant, leaving Count Holck with his wife, took the
supposed Mr. Frederikson by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lappel'">lapel</ins> of his coat, and led him a short
distance from his companion; and, after some circumlocution, asked him
plainly if the money was not for the use of Christian VII. The king, at
first, thought he was detected; but finding that not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the case, and that the merchant only wanted to get a share of a good
thing, he resolved to draw him on, in the hopes of amusement, and
answered his question in the affirmative. The merchant's eyes sparkled
with joy at this confession.</p>

<p>"I am told," he said, "that Christian VII. is one of the most
extravagant and thoughtless young dogs living, and cares no more for
money than if it could be raked out of the kennel. Of course you make
him pay handsomely&mdash;you understand me?"</p>

<p>It was with difficulty the king could refrain from laughter, but,
as gravely as he could, he told the money-dealer that he had drawn a
correct picture of the king's character.</p>

<p>"And pray, sir," the merchant said, significantly, "what is the
nature of your employment?"</p>

<p>"My chief employment," Christian replied, "consists in dressing the
king, and looking out for amusements."</p>

<p>"Just the thing!" said the merchant; "then you are more likely to
have influence."</p>

<p>"No man has more influence with him than I have; of that be
assured."</p>

<p>"Then of course you make a handsome profit out of these
transactions?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word and honour, I never made a profit on any pecuniary
transaction in my life."</p>

<p>The merchant's face lengthened, as he turned his small eyes
obliquely towards the king. After a pause, he began on another
tack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"How does the king dispose of these sums?"</p>

<p>"Gives them away, sometimes in coin or bank-notes; oftener in
presents of jewellery or other precious articles."</p>

<p>"Hark'ee, sir," said the merchant, delighted by these confessions,
"would you not wish to make the best of your influence with the
king?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I would."</p>

<p>"Then, if you will suffer me to instruct you, I will teach you how
to make fifty per cent. on the capital. Let me buy the jewels and
presents."</p>

<p>Just at that instant one of the king's pages arrived, and desired
the clerk to call his master, who was never less disposed to be
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," the messenger asked, "is not the King of Denmark in
your house?"</p>

<p>"The King of Denmark? No, sir, only a Mr. Frederikson."</p>

<p>"That is the king, the son of Frederick V. The gentleman with him
is Count Holck, master of his Majesty's wardrobe, and I am sent by the
Princess Dowager of Wales with orders to deliver this letter into his
Majesty's own hands."</p>

<p>The confusion of the merchant and his wife at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dénouement</i> may
safely be left to the imagination. The former disappeared, but the
good-natured king, forcing a ring on the fat finger of the latter,
and desiring her to tell her husband that Christian would never feel
offended at what he had said confidentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to Mr. Frederikson, skipped down stairs, laughing heartily at the
adventure, and regretting that it had been so suddenly terminated. Such
is the story as it is told, and I can only add, that si non è vero, è
ben trovato.</p>

<p>Walpole, who was prejudiced against Christian, probably because, at
the king's request, he sent him a collection of the Strawberry Hill
books, and received no answer,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> gives a very bitter account of him in
his reign of George III., although there is a certain amount of truth
in it. He says that the Danish king was in reality an insipid boy; and
there appeared no cause for his expensive ramble, though to support
it he had laid a tax on all his placemen and pensionaries. He took
notice of nothing, took pleasure in nothing, and hurried post through
most parts of England without attention, dining and supping at seats
on the road, without giving himself time enough to remark so much
of their beauties as would flatter the great lords who treated him.
This indifference was excused in a whisper by Bernstorff, his prime
minister, who attributed it to his Majesty's extreme short sight, which
Bernstorff confessed was the great secret of the state; yet Walpole
allows that the king's manner was very civil, and though his person was
diminutive and delicate, he did not want graceful dignity.</p>

<p>The natural good nature of the English made them
give the most favourable construction to the motives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of the king's travels, which were, in fact, the natural consequence of
his giddiness and levity. Whatever he seemed desirous of seeing, and
all the inquiries worthy of a monarch who seeks for instruction and
improvement in the arts, civilisation, and government, were suggested
by Count Bernstorff, the only man of merit and genius in his retinue.
His own inclination led him to plays, operas, balls, and excursions of
pleasure into the country, in which amusements a sovereign may indulge
occasionally, when they are intended as a relaxation from the grand
objects of useful study and information.</p>

<p>According to a well-informed author,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Christian,
while in London, was gracious and accessible, but without discernment
and without dignity. The very citizens of both sexes, who resorted
daily to his apartments to see him dine in public with his favourites,
mistook him more than once for a young girl dressed in men's clothes,
whose conversation and deportment commanded neither respect nor
attention.</p>

<p>Really the unhappy Danes had some cause for grumbling that their
hard-earned money was squandered in so very useless a fashion.</p>

<p>Before we accompany Christian VII. to the Circæan capital of
Europe, it will not be labour ill bestowed to take a glance at the
mode of conduct pursued by his wife during his absence. We have seen
that her <em>entourage</em> did not suit her, and she therefore lived in the
most perfect retirement. Though courted by the conflicting parties
which were beginning to be formed, she joined none, and did not show
the least ambition for political power. She appeared to feel a truly
maternal affection for her child, and, in spite of remonstrances, had
the infant and nurse to sleep in her apartment. She sometimes visited,
and was visited by, the queen dowager and Prince Frederick, but
generally remained in great seclusion. The only occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
on which she took part in public festivities was on the unveiling of
the equestrian statue of the late king, which was erected by the India
Company. The queens regnant and dowager accepted an invitation from
Count Moltke to witness the ceremony from his house, which faced the
site of the statue.</p>

<p>The queen had grown in stature, and appeared much more womanly than
when she arrived in Denmark. The glow of robust health was on her
cheek: she frequently nursed her child, and a more interesting subject
for a picture could scarcely be conceived than this healthy and lively
young queen playing with her babe. During this state of retirement,
Matilda visited the houses of the farmers and peasants who resided near
the palace; and though she could not converse fluently with these poor
grateful people, she gained their warm hearts by her condescension
in visiting their cottages, smiling graciously on their wives and
daughters, and distributing useful presents. Thus innocently Matilda
passed her time during the travels of her wild and dissipated husband.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Juliana Maria, on her side, lived in great retirement
with her son Frederick, at her château of Fredensborg.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
The small party of courtiers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
surrounded her were attached to her more by their salaries than
any affection. It is true that the terms on which the two queens
notoriously stood to each other attracted the attention of the
courtiers; but they were still too vague and undecided for any certain
plan to be based on them. The entire decay of the queen dowager's
influence on the one hand, and the too little known character of
Caroline Matilda on the other, promised them no support, if they
declared for either party. The king, on his departure, had displayed
neither the sentiments of an obedient son nor the attention of a loving
husband, and none of the statesmen at the head of affairs appeared
to be in special favour with him. The friendship of the courtiers,
which never springs up without selfish views, and cannot last without
tangible advantages, hence saw no object that could decide their choice.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>One thing appears tolerably certain, that Juliana Maria, while
remaining in seclusion, neglected no opportunity for widening the
breach between the young couple. Queen Matilda, it is evident, was
kept well informed of her husband's transgressions, as the following
passage, taken from a letter to her aunt, the Princess Amelia, will
show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish the king's travels had the same laudable objects as those of
Cyrus; but I find that the chief visitors of his Majesty are musicians,
fiddlers, and other persons designed for some employments still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
more inglorious: what a wretched levee! His evenings' amusements
are still more disgraceful, since delicacy and sentiment cannot be
supposed to dignify such transient gratifications. Had I not already
experienced his fickleness and levity at home, I could not have heard
without emotion and disquietude of his divers infidelities abroad. But
as it is the monarch, not the man, I received injunctions to marry, the
consciousness of having strictly adhered to my duty to his Majesty, and
the respect I owe to myself, form a secret satisfaction which neither
malice nor envy can deprive me of."</p>

<p>On the other hand, it appears tolerably certain that Juliana Maria
was a constant correspondent of Christian, and insinuated many things
against his wife's conduct. We are told that she went so far as to
state that the queen had been too intimate with some of her favourites,
and insinuated that several of his most faithful nobles had retired
to their estates during his absence, in order to avoid the insults of
some new men admitted to the young queen's favour. All these false
and malicious insinuations alienated the king's affection still more
from his amiable consort, who saw herself surrounded by spies who were
devoted to a dangerous enemy.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Had it been possible to corrupt Christian's morals
to any greater extent, his short stay in Paris would
have effected it. Since 1745, France had been slowly
and surely going down the slope that led to revolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Through internal and external misgovernment she had been driven nearer
to moral and social ruin, to a deficit, to utter dislocation and
corruption; but, for all that, the fifteenth Louis le Bienaimé was in
excellent case. The ancien régime, with its "gabelles," and "tailles,"
its "pactes de famille" and "acquits de comptant," its "lettres de
cachet," its Bastille, and its "cages de fer," with all its frivolity,
hardness of heart, shamelessness, and recklessness, was on the point
of sinking into the last stage of atrophy; but the royal roué, money
clipper, and coffee boiler, continued to find amusement for himself.</p>

<p>What a scene was that presented toward the end of February, 1745,
when the Hôtel de Ville of Paris gleamed with a thousand lights, and
its halls rang with seductive music! The city gave a ball to the court,
as a return for the festivities which had accompanied the marriage of
Louis the Dauphin. France was embroiled in an unfortunate war, which
paved the way for one still more unfortunate: but the court danced. The
king alone, of all the company, seemed absent and sad; while his wife,
the poor, good Maria Leczinska, found a motive for living in her phlegm
and her piety, his "favorite declarée," the "maîtresse en titre," the
Duchesse de Chateauroux, took it into her head to die. The haughty
noblesse of France, whom Louis XIV. had tamed, who had been corrupted
by the <em>rouerie</em> of the Regent, and degraded by Louis XV. to the duties
of the seraglio; the nobility of France, who had accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
themselves to reckon among their privileges that of supplying royal
concubines "du sang et rang," were most anxious to fill up the gap left
by the deceased duchesse. But this time even the practised Duc and
Maréchal de Richelieu failed, and in vain did that charming creature,
the Duchesse de Rochechouart, display all her Hebe-like charms, in the
hope of succeeding the Chateauroux. It was decreed that the French
aristocracy should lose one of their most precious privileges.</p>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville ball had attained the acme of its splendour. The
superbly decorated rooms which a few lustres later were to re-echo
saturnalia of a frightfully different nature, were crowded with
quaint and graceful maskers. Rococo was present in all the glory and
fancifulness of its refined voluptuousness, and a remarkably rich show
of feminine charms, heightened by all the coquetry of the toilette, was
offered to the choice of the royal purchaser, for the more official
object of the ball was to alleviate the "tristesse" of the lord of
France, and offer a remedy for his sadness in the form of a lovely
duchesse, comtesse, or baronesse.</p>

<p>Poor women of an immoral age! how many a girl, after her maid and
milliner had done their utmost, had been instructed by her mother,
how many a wife by her husband, how she should behave on this night
in order to attract and retain the king's favourable glances! For it
was a sign of an utterly corrupted epoch, that mothers considered they
fulfilled a duty in teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
their daughters to seek the highest honour in the
deepest disgrace.</p>

<p>This time, however, the plebeian rivalry was destined to bear away
the prize from the aristocrats. The Heliogabalus of France had really
forgotten his melancholy amid this abundance of beauty and seductions.
His restless eyes were at length fixed by a tall, graceful, fair-haired
girl, masked <em>en Amazone</em>, with bow and quiver on her shoulder, with
floating hair, and heaving bosom. "Charming huntress!" His most
Christian Majesty addressed her: "Happy the man who may be struck by
thy arrows." To speak in the style of the Academy, this was a splendid
moment to fire a dart into the king's heart; but whether the young
Amazon had not been properly trained, or did not take the hint, she
disappeared among the crowd of dancers. When on the point of pursuing
her, the Bienaimé was impeded by an English country dance, performed
by a bevy of young ladies. He devoured this "bouquet," so full of
fresh charms, and, as our authority says, "incertain, il eut voulu
les posséder toutes." The king went further, and surveyed at the end
of the room the amphitheatrical daïs on which "les femmes de médiocre
condition" were seated. Here, too, his Majesty found much to look at,
much to admire; till a female mask forced her way through the beautiful
crowd, and teased the king with masquerade freedom. The graceful
coquetry of this teasing attracted Louis's curiosity: there was a
grisettish <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> in the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the beauty, something new and piquant for the worn-out
roué. He begged her to unmask, and she did so while
flying, and, as she fled, she let her handkerchief fall.
The delighted king picked it up, and threw it over the
heads of the ladies to its owner. A whisper immediately
ran through the hall, "Le mouchoir est jété!"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The sultan had thrown the handkerchief, but not to a perfect
stranger. He had met the beauty frequently of late: while hunting in
the forest of Sénart, she had passed him, gracefully reclining in her
phaeton. Mademoiselle Poisson, now Madame d'Etioles, the daughter of
a scoundrel, had been artistically trained by her mother to become
an Odalisque. She had so often repeated to her daughter, "Tu es un
morceau de roi," that the girl at last believed it, and prepared
herself for the honour. In the interim, she married M. d'Etioles, the
rich nephew of her mother's lover, which,&mdash;such was the nature of
court morality at the period,&mdash;proved no obstacle, but rather a
motive for her future exalted position. Her mother, with this object,
negotiated with the king's first valet, Sieur Binet, the notorious
predecessor of the more notorious Lebel; and the talent of Madame
d'Etioles effected the rest.</p>

<p>The masked ball at the Hôtel de Ville entailed the finale. Ere long,
Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was invited by his most Christian Majesty
"pour souper dans ses petits cabinets et pour coucher avec elle."
Immediately after, this woman of one-and-twenty years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
age, who had been married four years and borne her husband two
children, was solemnly presented at court under the title of a Marquise
de Pompadour, to the queen, princes, and princesses, and in due form
declared "maîtresse en titre;" that is, as matters stood, the mistress
of France. Poor M. d'Etioles, "qui idolâtrait sa femme," tried at first
to be disagreeable, but was sent on his travels, and eventually became
appeased.</p>

<p>Everybody knows how the marquise governed France: it was she
who made the alliance with Austria and sent Prince de Soubise to
Rossbach. Under her government, France soon sank to such a point that
Chesterfield, writing home in December, 1753, from Paris, declared that
he found in that city all the signs of an impending revolution, such as
are read of in history. Poisson-Pompadour ruled, and woe to the man who
tried to oppose her autocracy: the dungeons of the Bastille or the iron
cages of Mont St. Michel received the victims to the revenge of the
Babylonish woman. The chanson and the satiric couplet alone dared to
flash in the dark, and at times darted their shafts into the innermost
apartments of the omnipotent lady.</p>

<p>In order to surround the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> sultan with all the varying charms
of seductiveness, the Pompadour, by Richelieu's advice, erected in
the park of Versailles a hermitage, where she tried to arouse the
blunted imagination of the roué, who had enjoyed everything and misused
everything, by dressing herself as a gardener's wife, or as a milkmaid,
or even as a nun. Nay, more:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
when these lures lost their charm in time, when the mistress heard that
his most Christian Majesty was tired of her, and declared that she was
as cold as a "macreuse," she assumed even more infamous duties, and
with Lebel established the Parc aux Cerfs, which will remain an undying
stain on regal France.</p>

<p>But even more horrible, possibly, is it to read, how the desire
of imitating the career of the Pompadour&mdash;the wish, the hope,
the longing to obtain the rank of maîtresse titrée&mdash;spread all
over France, from the pestilential court atmosphere of Versailles
to every point where a pretty girl was growing up. How shamelessly
people acted in this respect, is recorded by Casanova, in his account
of Mademoiselle Roman-Coupier, of Toulouse, who, however, only
succeeded in becoming an untitled concubine. The corruption of kings is
everywhere met half way by the villany of the nations. Regarding the
matter humanly, this offers a species of palliation for Louis XV. and
his co-religionists.</p>

<p>Après nous le déluge! was a fearful remark, which the Pompadour, in
the intoxication of her frivolity and might, or perhaps in a moment of
agony and desperation, replied to a friend who warned her against the
future; and the deluge came, but that of terror was preceded by that
of vulgarity. The ancien régime sank, draining the cup of vice to the
dregs, from the reign of the Poisson to that of the Dubarry&mdash;that
Dubarry, who, under the name of Mademoiselle L'Ange, had wallowed in
the vicious mud of Paris ere his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Christian Majesty raised her to his couch. The lowest of all Hetæras,
stretching herself on a bed of purple silk, and at her feet the King of
France, busily engaged in boiling his mistress's coffee, and rewarding
with a laugh of pleasure her Billingsgate remarks. What a picture!</p>

<p>Or, take as counterpart, the "maîtresse en titre," conversing with
the noblest ladies at court, one of whom, Madame de Beauveau, quietly
replied to the Dubarry's remark that they seemed to have a personal
hatred for her, "By no means; we should only like to be in your
place&mdash;that is all." The woman, in whose place the noblest-born
ladies wished themselves, dragged the language of the pothouse and the
bagnio into the apartments of Versailles; and Louis XV. took such a
delight in this mode of conversation, that he christened Mesdames, his
four legitimate daughters, the Princesses Sophie, Adelaide, Louise, and
Victorine, "graille, chiffe, loque, et coche."</p>

<p>This king even dishonoured and trailed in the mud the prestige of
royalty. What his extravagance cost France in ready money, no one
has been able to state certainly, but the lowest estimates amount to
200,000,000 of francs; and at that day, when millions could not be
conjured as they are now-a-day, a million was a large sum. But while
creatures like the Pompadour and the Dubarry had millions lavished
on them, the people, from whom the royal forestaller exacted these
millions, were starving. One day, while hunting in the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of Sénart, the "well-beloved" met a peasant carrying a coffin in his
cart. "Where are you taking that coffin?"&mdash;"To the village of
L&mdash;&mdash;." "Is it intended for a man or a woman?"&mdash;"For
a man." "What did he die of?"&mdash;"Starvation." The king drove his
spurs into his horse. Did he feel a burning within him like the flames
of Hades? I doubt it. He had only a cynical laugh for everything, even
for the monkey-tricks performed by his mistress at the council of
state. Was it surprising that the most awful things should be believed
about such a king?&mdash;that a rumour spread among the populace that
it was one of the mysteries of the Parc aux Cerfs that the king tried
to stimulate his senses by baths of children's blood?</p>

<p>I need hardly stop to discuss the views and morals of French society
under such a king; but a man who was a member of this society&mdash;a
man who did not reproach it, but comfortably swam with the stream of
vice&mdash;shall tell us something about it. "The gallantry which
had prevailed at the court of Louis XIV. became, in the time of the
Regency, unbridled sensuality. Under Louis XV., the gentlemen were
solely engaged in augmenting the lists of their mistresses, and the
ladies in depriving each other of their lovers with marked publicity.
Husbands, compelled to suffer what they could not prevent, without
making themselves in the highest degree ridiculous, adopted the safe
remedy of no longer living with their wives. They only met them at
public resorts; but at other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
times, though living under the same roof, they never came together.
Matrimony was regarded as a mere matter of money, and generally as an
inconvenience, which could only be avoided by laying aside all the
duties it entailed. Morals, it is true, were ruined by this; but good
society (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la société</i>) gained enormously.
Freed from the constraint and coldness which the presence of husbands
and wives always produces, the liberty was unbounded. The mutual
coquetry of gentlemen and ladies enlivened everything, and supplied
every day with piquant adventures."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>In truth, there was no want of such piquancy as we read of in
Suetonius, Petronius, and Juvenal. Princesses behaved at night, in the
garden of the Palais Royal, in such a way as to place themselves on a
level with its professional <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habituées</i>. Such was the case with the
Duchesse de Chartres, mother of Philippe Egalité, who was publicly told
by an offended rival: "Je n'ai pas encore éprouvé, madame, qu'on eût
besoin d'argent pour trouver des amoureux."</p>

<p>Or take Magdaleine de Villeroy, Duchesse de Boufflers, who contrived
to become a woman "qu'il fallait que tout homme de bon air mît sur sa
liste." In the life of this woman, perhaps the slightest scandal was
that she lived quite openly with the Maréchal de Luxembourg, while the
latter, as a compensation, just as openly placed his own wife at the
disposal of his mistress's husband. One day the Duc de Durfort, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of this lady's countless admirers, gave her a supper, and, to amuse the
company, invited the comedian Chassé. After the lady had imbibed an
inordinate quantity of champagne, as was her wont, she so unequivocally
revealed her inclinations toward the actor that the host thought
it advisable to dismiss him. The duchesse, however, rushed, with
flying hair, down the street after him, shrieking, "Je le veux! Je le
veux!"</p>

<p>Such were the ladies whom the Prince de Conti was justified in
insulting, by saying to Louis XV., when the latter asked him why
France produced no more marshals, "C'est qu'aujourd'hui nos femmes
ont affaire à leurs laquais." In this circle, which only lived for
the lowest sensuality, everything was degraded. Thus there was a Duc
de Gesvres, who assumed the manner and avocations of a woman; he
rouged himself, wielded the fan, and worked embroidery. Everything was
brought low, everything disgraced; and a levity of the most odious
nature was displayed in religious matters. What could the Church be and
signify with persons who had seen a Dubois made a cardinal? And was
not Bernis, too, a cardinal?&mdash;the same Bernis, christened "Suzon
la Bouquetière," who once preached at the reception of a nun of noble
birth, and had the misfortune, while going into the pulpit, to let fall
a piece of paper, on which he had written a most scandalous couplet
about the novice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>As is usual in such degenerate times, the coarsest superstition was
mixed up with the most frivolous free-thinking. The spirit of religious
reform, brutally suppressed on its manifestation as Jansenism, had
only been able to penetrate the universal rottenness in the caricature
of Convulsionism. After the immoral mania of these revivalists went
out of fashion, calling up spirits and demons grew popular among the
great. At court, Saint Germain, the manufacturer of diamonds and the
elixir of life, the predecessor of the clumsy charlatan Cagliostro,
was called on to kill time for the yawning king and the Pompadour. In
the Palais Royal, Casanova erected his cabalistic pyramids of figures;
and for the entire fashionable female world, the coffee-cup of the
fortune-teller Bontemps was a Delphic oracle. With extravagance and
superstition, their sister, cruelty, naturally went hand in hand. When
in March, 1757, Damiens was executed, the fashionable ladies hurried
to a nameless act of barbarism, at their head being the pretty wife of
Popelinière, the farmer-general, who had gained a great reputation in
society by a scandalous intrigue with the sinner of sinners, the Duc de
Richelieu. In order to learn what people were capable of in the Paris
of that day, the reader ought to be acquainted with the awful sketch
drawn by Casanova, the most decried but most masterly painter of the
morals of the eighteenth century, of the execution of Damiens.</p>

<p>In the midst of this ocean of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boue de Paris</i> there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
was one source of consolation; in spite of the shame with which Soubise
and his consorts had stained the lily banner, the warlike temper of
the French was not utterly destroyed. In such an age as the one we
are describing, there is something doubly cheering in reading of that
well-known trait of French chivalry which characterises an episode of
the battle of Fontenoy. The English and French guards marched to meet
each other for a combat which would become very murderous. "Messieurs
des gardes Françaises," Lord Charles Hay shouted from the English
ranks, "tirez!" "Non, my lord," Comte d'Auteroche replied from the
French side; "nous ne tirons jamais les prémiers."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
And there is more than chivalrous courtesy, there is the noblest
heroism, in the circumstance that at the surprise, on 16th October,
1760, which the hereditary prince of Brunswick attempted at Kloster
Kamp upon the Marquis de Castries, the Chevalier d'Assas, of the
Auvergne regiment, when surrounded at the outposts by the enemy, still
shouted, under the menace of a hundred bayonets, the warning cry, "A
moi, Auvergne, voilá les ennemis!"<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian landed at Calais, and though he now resumed his incognito,
and travelled as a Count of Gottorp, he was everywhere received as
king. He reached Paris on the 21st, passing through Saint Omer, Lille,
Douai, Valenciennes, and Cambrai, and lodged at the York palace, which
had been engaged for his stay in the French capital, and where he was
complimented by the Duc de Choiseul, in the name of the absent King
Louis XV., and invited to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Being now in the country whose language was most fluent and
agreeable to him, Christian VII. visited on the day after his arrival,
accompanied by the Duc de Duras, who was appointed his chevalier of
honour, the Théâtre-Français and the Grand Opéra. On the 23rd, he set
out with his whole suite for Fontainebleau, to pay his first visit to
King Louis. On his arrival, he was received at the foot of the marble
staircase by the Duc d'Orléans, greeted at the top by the Dauphin, and
conducted to the door of the royal cabinet. When he presented himself
for the first time to Louis XV., that monarch, who had never in his
life been able to address a word to a new face, embraced the King of
Denmark without saying a word to him, and turned to speak to the Count
von Bernstorff, because he had known him formerly during his embassy in
France. The King of Denmark, who felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
incongruity of this reception, at once pirouetted on his heel and
addressed the Duc de Choiseul, who soon contrived to draw his master
into the conversation begun with the young monarch.</p>

<p>While Von Gleichen, the Danish envoy, was negotiating with Choiseul
as to the manner in which Christian was to be received, he was urged
to obtain leave that the two monarchs should meet alone on the first
interview, that when the doors were shut the King of France should
give the title of Majesty to him of Denmark, and that afterwards
the latter should remain in the strictest incognito. M. de Choiseul
answered Gleichen that, "though he had his Majesty's commands to
assent to everything requested in the matter of etiquette, he ought
to be aware that his demand was impossible, as the King of France
had never remained alone for a single moment in his life, not even
in his garderobe, and that he had no power to expel from his chamber
persons who by right of office had a claim to remain in it." The first
interview, therefore, took place in the presence of all the chief
personages, but when, on the next day, Louis XV. returned Christian's
visit, accompanied by a few princes of the blood and his whole court,
the youthful monarch ran to meet the King of France, took his hand,
and, walking very quickly, drew him into his cabinet, the door of which
he locked. All this was done so promptly, that the Duc d'Orléans,
pushed by the crowd who were eager to follow, ran against the door, and
thus Louis XV. remained alone with a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
for the first time in his life. The two monarchs conversed together for
some time, and were mutually charmed; but afterwards Christian said to
Gleichen, "Do you remember what you wrote us about the impossibility of
a King of France remaining alone? I succeeded better than you, for I
took a pleasure in it."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>During this interview the King of France expressed his regret that
the deep mourning for his consort, Maria Leczinska, prevented him from
celebrating the visit of his brother, at which he was greatly pleased,
by court festivities, but he had taken care that his Danish Majesty's
stay in Paris should be rendered as pleasant as possible. As he was
aware that his beloved guest was fond of theatres, he had sent his
commands both to the Comédie Française and the Opéra, that during the
Danish king's presence only such pieces should be performed as his
exalted guest wished to see.</p>

<p>Louis XV. conversed with the perfect courtesy of a French courtier.
"In the year 1717," he said, "my predecessor on the throne of France
had the felicity of seeing Peter the Great here, and I have great
pleasure in being able to embrace Christian the amiable. How young you
are! I could be your grandfather."</p>

<p>"I should esteem myself most fortunate if I were your grandson,"
Christian replied.</p>

<p>When the French king introduced his guest to the
ladies of the court, he noticed that Christian paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
special attention to Madame de Flavecourt. Hence he drew him on one
side, and asked him,</p>

<p>"How old do you take that lady to be?"</p>

<p>"Thirty, at the most," Christian remarked.</p>

<p>"She is above forty," said Louis.</p>

<p>"A proof, sire, that people do not grow old at your court," was
Christian's flattering answer.</p>

<p>During the four days' stay at Fontainebleau, Struensee visited the
Galerie des Cerfs, where the degenerate daughter of Gustavus Adolphus,
after her abdication, had her lover Monaldeschi, whom she supposed to
be faithless, beheaded by three disguised accomplices. He was induced
to pay this visit by a dream, in which he saw an exalted lady, whose
name he hardly dared confess. He had returned a long time from the
tour, ere he told his brother of this dream, and how it urged him
the next day to visit the gallery. "Everything is possible," was the
consolatory answer Struensee received.</p>

<p>On November 3, the court celebrated the festival of St. Hubert, in
which Christian took part with his suite. The guests arrived in one
thousand five hundred carriages, and over three thousand hunters and
lackeys were called out. Naturally, Madame de Flavecourt was among the
fair Amazons.</p>

<p>On November 13, the Prince de Monaco gave the king a ball, at which
the royal guest made the acquaintance of the Duchesse de Nevers, the
ex-actress Marie-Anne Quinault, in the dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever the king was not impeded by other festivities, he visited
the Théâtre-Français, and for every performance sent the troupe 1,000
crowns, so that this amusement alone cost him 20,000 crowns. At the
Grand Opéra he was most attracted by the celebrated prima donna Sophie
Arnould, whom he requested to hear thrice as Théalire, in Rameau's
<cite>Castor and Pollux</cite>. As a return for the pleasure which her singing and
acting caused him, he sent her, through Count Holck, an ivory fan, for
which he paid Boucher 2,000 livres.</p>

<p>When Christian visited the celebrated porcelain factory at Sèvres,
he was shown an entire dinner service which Louis XV. intended to
present to him, each piece decorated with the arms of Denmark. On Nov.
20, Christian was present at a sitting of the Academy, where Voisenon
received him with a piece of verses, which I will spare the reader, and
only say, they are full of the usual fulsome flattery. A resolution was
then passed to hang up the king's full-length portrait in the great
hall. On the 21st, Christian visited the Academy of Painting, when he
was received by the Marquis de Marigny, brother of Madame de Pompadour,
with an address, and on the same day the Sorbonne, where the same
honours were paid him as to Peter the Great fifty years before.</p>

<p>A few days later, there appeared in the <cite>Mercure</cite> a versified
panegyric on the king by a member of the Académie Française, M. de
Bernis, ex-drawing-master, and afterwards archbishop, and favourite of
the Pompadour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
in which we read the tolerably notorious fact that other princes had
visited the banks of the Seine before Christian. The unfortunate James
Stuart was regretted; the pious Casimir forgotten; Peter I. admired;
"mais vous, Chrétien, vous êtés adoré." In another set of verses, I
find four lines which must not be passed over. I regret that I cannot
trace their author; but they will be found in the "Almanach des Muses"
for 1769:&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Really, it is difficult to decide whether France would have been a
loser by the change.</p>

<p>After so many compliments had been paid him by the servants of
Paris, King Christian wished to form the personal acquaintance of the
most renowned academicians of the day, and hence invited twenty of them
to dinner. Among them were d'Alembert, Diderot, Helvetius, Marmontel,
la Condamine, Voisenon, &amp;c. The king seated himself between Diderot
and Helvetius, and spoke in terms of praise of the "Bijoux Indiscrets"
of the one, and the "&OElig;uvres Philosophiques" of the other, and
delighted all his learned guests by his affability. Struensee was also
at table, and through his clever remarks about French literature and
the Empress of Russia, more especially attracted the admiration of his
immediate neighbours, who were Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
von Grimm, the Saxe-Coburg Envoy and news-writer to Catharine II., the
private secretary of the Duc d'Orléans, and the playwright Saurin.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the king visited the parliament, when he was received
by the celebrated Advocate-General Séquier with a Latin speech, of
which it is doubtful whether he understood much. After this, Christian
paid a three days' visit to the Prince of Condé at Chantilly. This
entertainment was probably the finest of all those given to Christian.
As it was free to all persons, it was computed that there were at least
six thousand guests present, and the concourse of nobility and gentry
of both sexes to it was so prodigious, that the Rue St. Denis, which
is longer than Holborn, was so filled with carriages from end to end,
that there was no passage through it. The entertainment continued for
three days and nights, during which open house was kept for all comers,
without distinction. There was likewise a very grand hunt in the forest
by torch-light. After a wild boar had been chased for a long while, a
nobleman killed it with a bow and arrow.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
The cost of this entertainment was defrayed by Louis XV., and a full
account of all the festivities that took place was forwarded to the
Empress of Russia by Grimm.</p>

<p>Such were Christian's public performances in Paris, but his private
ones were of the same nature as in London, so far as the genius of the
two countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
admitted. Ladies of high rank, flattered by the homage of the monarch,
while they despised the man, disputed the unenviable notoriety of
his attentions; and in the court of Louis XV., which was immersed in
gallantry, Christian found an example and sanction for every excess.
The two kings frequently supped together <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en partie carrée</i>, laying
aside in mutual freedom and convivial mirth all stateliness and
majesty. The time fixed for Christian's departure made him forget the
trammels of royalty; and, in taking his leave of the French monarch,
he declared Versailles and Paris, under his Majesty's auspices, the
favourite abode of Apollo, Venus, and Minerva.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Accompanied by the Comte de Noailles and the Prince de Poix,
Christian witnessed, on Dec. 6, the display of the fountains at the
royal palaces of Marly, Trianon, and Versailles; and, at the latter,
was magnificently entertained by Louis XV. in farewell.</p>

<p>Before he left Paris, Christian VII. offered on his return to his
states to raise a new cavalry regiment for the French service, and
give the command of it to the Duc de Duras and his descendants
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in perpetuum</i>. When Caroline Matilda heard of
this, she wittily remarked that "the king was a very good Frenchman,
but a very bad politician." This was communicated to Christian with
many aggravating circumstances by the emissaries of the queen dowager.
Another observation attributed to the queen on hearing of her husband's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
successes in Paris, that "if he had travelled <em>incog.</em>, he would have
returned to his dominions with a blank list of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</i>," was
doubtless an invention of malice. Probably the offer of the regiment
was declined; at any rate, no trace of it is to be found in the Danish
archives.</p>

<p>All the poets who sang the praises of Chrétien l'adoré&mdash;and
among the panegyrics I find the following neat exception to the rule of
worthlessness, written by M. de Chamfort:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Peuple a qui sa présence est chère,</div>
  <div class="i0">Parmi vous retenez ses pas:</div>
  <div class="i0">Une roi qu'on aime et qu'on révère</div>
  <div class="i0">A des sujets en tous climats.</div>
  <div class="i0">Il a beau parcourir la terre,</div>
  <div class="i0">Il est toujours dans ses états"&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>all the artists who had counterfeited him, the sculptors who had
represented him, the actors and prima donnas who had amused him, were
rewarded with truly royal gifts. Even the Dames de la Halle, who had
employed their old privilege of handing a bouquet to crowned heads,
and whose leader also requested permission to give him a kiss, were
willingly received by the fun-loving youth.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
When the pretty spokeswoman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
expressed her wish, he laughingly offered her first one cheek and then
the other, with the words: "Eh bien, madame, choisissez!" The clever
Parisienne, however, took the liberty of kissing both cheeks, and
received as reward 20 louis d'or. The king left a present of 6,000
livres for the poor of Paris, though his own were starving.</p>

<p>On the last day of his stay in the world's capital, Christian gave
the Duc de Duras&mdash;in addition to his miniature painted by the
Danish artist Jans Juel, and set in diamonds&mdash;a gold-mounted sword
of honour set with pearls and jewels, valued at 20,000 livres. The
duc's wife received a diamond necklace, and Madame de Flavecourt, whose
beauty had attracted the king on his first arrival, a valuable suite of
pearls.</p>

<p>The king's portrait was displayed in all the windows, and under it
could be read the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is really a painful task to dispel the favourable
opinion expressed of Christian VII. in these verses,
but I am bound to be impartial. Reverdil tells us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
bluntly that in France, in spite of the flattery employed, and the
prejudice in the king's favour entertained by those who only caught a
transient glance of him, such persons as were in daily intercourse with
him, and were able to watch him closely, detected in him an incipience
of mania, and heard him make extravagant remarks. They also noticed
that in his moments of aberration, a glance from Holck recalled him to
his senses.</p>

<p>After a stay of seven weeks, Christian quitted Paris on December
9, in order to return to his own states. At Metz he allowed himself
to be detained for three days by all sorts of festivities offered him
by Maréchal d'Armentières, and proceeded thence to Strasburg, where
he arrived on the 16th, and accepted an invitation from the Elector
Carl Theodore of the Palatinate to travel <em>viâ</em> Mannheim. On the 18th
he arrived in the latter city, and was received with all imaginable
ostentation. After visiting, on the following day, the Electoral
Library, Academy of Sciences, Treasury, picture gallery, and cabinet of
coins, and being presented by his host with a series of medals of the
electors coined in Rhine gold, Christian continued his journey on the
28th to Hanau, in order to visit his two sisters.</p>

<p>After four days' stay here, the king travelled through Cassel and
Brunswick, and reached Hamburg on New Year's Day, where he was received
with a royal salute. On January 4 he arrived at Altona, the first city in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
his dominions, and was welcomed by all possible demonstrations of joy.
The children of the Orphan Hospital and other charities were ranged in
two lines, with wax tapers in their hands, as his Majesty passed to
the palace. All the houses were illuminated, and a grand emblematical
firework, inscribed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">optimo regi</i>, was played off, which was followed
by a grand masked ball. Here, too, Christian received his last heavy
discharge of verse, in the shape of a panegyric, from one Madame Wildin
of Glückstadt, in which the lady, with extensive view, surveys mankind
from Copenhagen to London and Paris. Her account of the English is so
droll that room must be made for it:&mdash;</p>

<p>From Altona the Danish monarch proceeded to Ahrensburg,
and remained for two days on the estate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
his marshal of the journey, Baron von Schimmelmann. After this short
rest the journey was continued so hurriedly, that, on January 14, after
an absence of seven months, he made his festal entry into his capital
by the side of Queen Caroline Matilda, who drove out to Roeskilde to
meet him. At night the whole city was illuminated, for the nation still
expected a fortunate change at any moment, and would not be disabused,
although their hope was constantly deceived.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="p1">JOHN FREDERICK STRUENSEE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>THE INTERIM MINISTRY&mdash;STATE OF THE NATION&mdash;THE KING'S
HEALTH&mdash;THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER&mdash;STRUENSEE&mdash;HIS EDUCATION
AND CAREER&mdash;HIS FRIENDS&mdash;SHACK ZU RANTZAU&mdash;THE
TRAVELLING SURGEON&mdash;THE COURT DOCTOR&mdash;THE
PARTIES AT COURT&mdash;PLANS OF CAROLINE MATILDA.</p></blockquote>


<p>The three ministers who had managed the affairs of state during
the King of Denmark's absence, were Counts von Thott and Moltke, and
Herr von Rosenkrantz. The first attended to home affairs; the second
occupied the post of foreign minister, rendered vacant by Bernstorff's
absence; and the third was at the head of the War Office. The Admiralty
had recently lost a respected chief, through the removal of old Count
von Danneskjold Samsöe, and Count von Danneskjold Laurvig, who took his
place, was far from filling it worthily. Of these four men, Rosenkrantz
was the only one to whom the attention of those who sought a party
leader could be turned. He was a thorough man of the world; a noble
air, insinuating politeness, elegant manners, a polished mind, a great
propensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
for intrigue, and an artistic suppleness, were the principal qualities
of this man, and rendered him well fitted to play a part in court
intrigues. But it was as yet too early to think of forming a party. The
first period of the king's government had offered too many examples
that the highest favour and the lowest fall were too near together for
any one to place confidence either in his own good luck, or that of
another person.</p>

<p>The three other men I have mentioned, regarded the court quarrels
as intrigues that were beneath them. Count von Thott, an honest and
well-informed man, had a rich source of consolation against any blow of
fate in himself and his acquirements. In every conjuncture he proved
equal to himself and his merits. He accepted whatever fortune offered
him without arrogance, and lost it without despondency. Such a man was
not born for political intrigue. Count von Moltke had played such a
brilliant part in the last reign; he had so carefully and cautiously
profited by the favouring circumstances of that day; he was so highly
respected throughout the kingdom, that there was reason for believing
that, under all circumstances, he would be alone able to withstand any
opposition offered him by the court. It is true, that his ambition
was notorious. It was known that he regarded pomp as an indispensable
accompaniment of happiness. But people also reflected that there is an
age when the spur of ambition becomes blunted, and when a man does not
care to sacrifice the pleasant repose of undisturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
happiness to imaginary and uncertain prospects.</p>

<p>Count Laurvig had only the manner and acquirements which are
attained by long practice and intimacy with high society. He had also
ever sacrificed his reputation to his pleasures; and, in some affairs,
had behaved with such recklessness, that he had forfeited the general
respect which he possessed before these errors. With such principles,
no man can advance far on the path of ambition. From the last three
members of the government, therefore, no complicated court intrigues
could be anticipated.</p>

<p>The Danish people, at this time, were in a state of sullen
discontent. They were dissatisfied with the maintenance of the poll
tax, which they had been promised should be soon abolished, when it
was established in 1762, on the occasion of an impending war with
Russia; but they were probably more dissatisfied with the way in which
the money was spent than with the tax itself. The Norwegians, more
especially, were very angry, and broke into complaints, whose tone
was extremely serious. This dissatisfaction had hardly been appeased,
and the people were beginning to endure the burden more patiently,
when a new source of sorrow and anger was opened for the nation. This
was the king's costly tour, which exhausted the finances, and caused
a suspension of all the outlay, by which the nation had previously
profited. Road-making, the maintenance of the royal palaces, the
proposed augmentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of the army, were all prevented. Ready money was sent out of the
country; the rate of exchange with Hamburg rose enormously; trade began
to sink, and credit almost disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In this sad condition, Christian found his kingdom on his return.
His fickle mind, which dwelt on nothing that did not relate to his
own insignificant amusements, prevented him from weighing the serious
nature of these facts, and destroyed in him every feeling that should
have called his attention to them. On the other hand, we must allow,
that all who now saw the king again, were struck by the favourable
change which the tour had produced in him. He had acquired an elegant
manner, and laid aside many of his bad habits. At the same time, he
had really examined much abroad, and thus gained wider views. Hence,
Bernstorff was complimented on the good results of the royal trip,
and people seemed quite to overlook the fact that Holck was still
Christian's intimate friend; and that, on the 25th August last, the
king had appointed him Grand Maître de la Garderobe et des plaisirs, by
which the count was raised to the rank of a privy councillor, only nine
months after his nomination as a gentleman of the bed-chamber. In fact,
the king's attachment to his favourite had attained such a height, that
one day, in England, by Christian's orders, the couriers' horses were
almost ridden to death, solely to bring up the count in time to be
present at a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
party, where he would meet the new lady of his love. For Count Holck
had been left a widower after only a few weeks' marriage with the
delicate Fräulein von Stockfleth, but speedily contrived to console
himself. He fell in love with Lady Bel Stanhope, and Christian himself
interposed on his behalf. The mother was not averse, but Lady Bel
very sensibly refused. His rival was Sackville, afterwards Duke of
Dorset, of whom, as Walpole tells us, he said "ce gros noir n'est pas
beau," which implied, that he thought his own whiteness and pertness
charming. Amusing tales were whispered about the intimacy of the king
and the master of the wardrobe, and their amours during the tour; and,
in truth, after the first impression had worn off, the king's state of
health, which had never been satisfactory, proved of what nature the
amusements of the friends must principally have been. The incessant
variety of stupifying amusements, and, at the same time, an excessive
indulgence in sensual pleasures, had evidently exhausted the king, and
undermined his moral and physical powers.</p>

<p>We can quite understand how the complaints about augmentation of the
taxes grew louder when it was found that the chief object of the tour,
the moral improvement of the young king, had been an utter failure.
Enormous sums had to be found to pay for the articles purchased in
England and France, and fresh loans, as a necessary result, raised.
Matters now came to such a pitch that the Treasury was unable to
satisfy the current expenses, which caused great embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
And it must be borne in mind that the Danish population was not in a
condition to endure any increased taxation. Prince Charles of Hesse
gives us a dreadful picture of the country as it remained from the
time when he first visited it up to the reign of Frederick VI. The
peasant was a serf in Denmark in the fullest meaning of the term. There
was no justice for him; no protection against his owner. Many of the
latter had been the bailiffs, who had ruined their absent masters, and
eventually purchased their estates. The wretched Danish peasant stood
under the merciless whip of these vile men. He was at the mercy of his
master, who compelled him to take a poor farm and put it in order, and
when he had got it into a good state by the sweat of his brow and his
industry, drove him out to do the same at another farm. The master
forced him to marry whomsoever he thought proper. At the slightest
opposition, he handed over the wretch to the militia, or sold him for
50 crowns to a captain, on condition that he would never again be
allowed to set foot in his native province.</p>

<p>Jütland was the most trampled province; but in Zeeland affairs
were worst of all, for there the peasant was almost quite brutalized.
He possessed a number of small horses, which, in winter, supported
themselves almost exclusively on grass or roots, which they scratched
from under the snow; little carts in which the boors took a small lot of
grain to market; huts that resembled those of savages&mdash;such was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
almost hideous aspect of this fair province. The only market which
even the most distant farmers could attend was held at Copenhagen.
They came to market, made their sales, ran to the tavern to drink,
started home drunk, and with loosened rein, but stopped punctually at
every pothouse, of which there was one every mile, so that they might
not emerge from the only happy condition they knew. At the same time,
Denmark derived everything from abroad; and Hamburg was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepôt</i>
of articles of luxury, delicate eating, and dainty vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> From such a
sketch, we can easily understand why the nation groaned in spirit at
the extravagant outlay entailed by the king's hopeless tour.</p>

<p>Under such depressing circumstances, the nation was naturally
greatly annoyed at finding that the treasury had frequently to aid
Count Holck in defraying his lavish expenditure. Thus, for instance,
he purchased the Blaagaard Villa, in front of the northern gate of the
capital, and decorated it with handsome new buildings and fine gardens.
Nothing more was heard, however, of the former nocturnal scenes, as we
have seen how the king's first mistress was expelled from Copenhagen.
From this time, the police were enabled to do their duty during any
night rows, while, prior to the king's tour, the police-master had been
ordered not to interfere with the king or any of his suite. The result
of this was, that many offences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
committed by other persons were attributed to the king.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>After the king's return, a different mode of life was
introduced at court,&mdash;the former short dinner-hour was lengthened,
and, though kept within the limits of ceremony, employed for general
conversation. The king inspected the docks and scientific institutions
of the capital, probably with the object of comparing them with those
he had seen abroad. It was also noticed with satisfaction that the king
was beginning to busy himself with the affairs of government, which, it
was supposed, must be ascribed to Bernstorff's good influence, although
the premier was still unable to carry out his favourite decree of
attaining the dignity of Grand Chancellor.</p>

<p>The court itself had also grown more lively. The two queen dowagers
and the hereditary Prince Frederick had sought, during the last summer,
amusement by paying each other visits at their summer houses, and by
staying with the nobles at their country seats. The reigning queen,
however, remained at Frederiksberg, and found her only delight in her
little son, the crown prince. In September, she and Juliana Maria
returned to the capital to spend the winter there; and at the beginning
of autumn, the opening of the theatre afforded them some slight
amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>In proportion as the king declined and degenerated in his physical
and intellectual powers, Matilda had made more than proportionate
advances. Her person was much increased in height and breadth; her air
and appearance were more dignified and imposing; her mind seemed to
have acquired firmness; and, on their first interview, her conscious
husband absolutely started at the improved appearance of his queen;
reflecting on his own imbecility, he seemed half reluctant, half afraid
to meet her.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that intrigues were at work, during the king's absence,
to heighten the alienation he felt from his wife, and ere long his
behaviour to her subsided from cold familiarity into cruel disrespect.
Matilda, who felt a reluctance to acquaint the royal family in England
with the daily mortifications and slights she met with from the king
and his step-mother, gave vent to her grief and vexation in a letter
which she wrote to the Princess Mary of Hesse Cassel. This lady's
consanguinity with the King of Denmark, and the marriage of her son
with Christian's sister, doubtless suggested the application to her.
The following is an exact copy of the letter:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p5"><span class="smcap">Copenhagen</span>, <i>March 22, 1769</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Madam and good Aunt</span>,</p>

<p>You are not unacquainted with the arts, devices,
and aspiring views of the queen dowager, who seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
solely bent on undermining the royal authority, the exercises of
which she assumes solely to herself; and, after having made the king
contemptible to his subjects, in availing herself of his weakness,
to give a sanction to the most flagrant acts of violence, injustice,
and oppression. She has forfeited all claims to the sentiments of
forgiveness and moderation I have too long manifested, in opposition
to censure, insolence, and obloquy, by her last most injurious and
false aspersions on my reputation and the dignity of a reigning queen.
I am amazed at the king's torpor and insensibility. If any person of
my attendance shows a laudable zeal for my service, or a respectful
attachment to my person, it is reputed a crime, and punished with royal
displeasure and dismission. Some reasons dictated by prudence have
prevented me from troubling the king, my brother, on this disagreeable
subject, as he might perhaps think it highly improper to interfere in
grievances which he has no right to redress. I have applied to your
known benevolence to do me the kind office of advising me, that I may
bring the king to a sense of his wrongs and his injustice. Would you
take upon yourself; as for as it is consistent with your discretion, to
assist me in such a perplexing situation. I could never sufficiently
acknowledge your friendly interposition to restore the peace of mind
of</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">Your affectionate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Princess Mary begged the queen, her niece, would excuse her from
taking any part in these royal feuds, which, instead of producing the
desired effect, might perhaps stimulate her rival's vengeance, to offer
her Majesty some new affronts and indignities. She professed, at the
same time, a great concern for her troubles and anxiety, hoping her
Majesty's good sense and conduct would confound the vile imputations of
Juliana, and make the king sensible of his errors.</p>

<p>If the public entertained any doubts as to the terms on which the
king and queen stood to each other, they were removed when the court
proceeded, in May, to the palace of Frederiksberg, near Copenhagen.
This gave the affair another turn, and soon dispelled the good opinion
about a change in the king's mode of life, and the fancied wedded
happiness of the young queen. Count Holck now lived at the "Blue Farm,"
in close proximity to the summer residence of the court, after being
married on May 8, to the Countess Juliana Sophia, daughter of the
admiral, Count Danneskjold Laurvig, which, however, did not prevent
him from continuing his old course of life. Elegant court dames lodged
for the summer in villas round his country seat, and a constant
communication was kept up between Frederiksberg and the "Blaagaard."</p>

<p>In July, a visit from the Duke of Gloucester, brother of Queen
Caroline Matilda, gave occasion for numerous court festivities, but
also for an increased dislike on the part of the queen against the
favourite. One day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the king asked Count Holck, whom the duke resembled? And the impudent
favourite answered, "An English ox." The duke was in truth extremely
stout, and had a corresponding broad face. The king laughed at his
favourite's joke, but was so malicious as to repeat Holck's sally to
the queen. The duke appears to have enjoyed himself right royally
while in Copenhagen, for we read that he and his gentlemen indulged so
immoderately at table, after the fashion of the age, that they were
obliged to take foot-baths, and use other preventives, for fear of an
attack of apoplexy before morning.</p>

<p>The boldness which the favourite displayed, and the loose life he
himself led, and to which he habituated the king, at length aroused
a party against him, which plainly increased more and more daily. At
the head of it was the Supreme Court Marshal Frederick Christian von
Moltke, who had recently been deposed on behalf of a man who in other
respects stood far below him. But this Count Moltke did not possess
the cleverness and practised craft of his father, and did not know how
to overthrow the arrogant favourite. This was reserved for another
man, from whom it had not been expected. This man of bourgeois origin
contrived within a short period to remove not only Count Holck, but
nearly all those in authority, and to introduce a spirit into the
government which, had it not been overthrown, might have had the best
consequences for land and nation; for the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of his reforms were such as had endured a lengthened trial. This man
was Dr. Struensee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Frederick Struensee</span> was born at
Halle, on August 5, 1737, where his father, Adam Struensee, the son of
a cloth-factor, in New Ruppin, was at the time preacher at St. Ulrich's
Church. His mother, Maria Dorothea, was the only daughter of Dr. Carl,
a man given to mysticism, who had been appointed physician in ordinary
by Christian VII.'s grandfather, and died in 1757, as a practising
physician at Mildorf, in Dittmarsch, at the great age of ninety years.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Struensee had light brown, almost flaxen hair, blue, sharp, and
flashing eyes, an aquiline nose, and a high forehead; he was firmly
built, and gifted with an admirable ability, great desire for learning,
and a most excellent memory.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> He received his first education
at the Orphan School of his native town, where religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
instruction was not only treated superficially, but several of his
teachers were also given to mysticism. In their lessons they constantly
said, "This you must believe, because God has spoken so in the Bible,"
but offered no proof that the Bible was really the word of God.
Struensee concluded from this, that his teachers regarded the Bible
as of divine origin, solely because they had been taught so in their
youth, and was not satisfied with this.</p>

<p>It happened on one occasion that many of his fellow-pupils, of whom
several were of notoriously loose morals, declared that they had been
suddenly enlightened and converted. All sorts of edifying exercises
were at once performed with these young men. Struensee, and others of
his school friends, who were not among the enlightened, considered
this ridiculous; and the foolish penance which the teachers imposed
upon them in consequence, rendered Struensee only the more obstinate.
The pietistic teachers declared that it was as godless to go about in
ruffles and powdered hair as to commit actual sin. Struensee drew from
this the conclusion, that as the former cannot possibly be sinful,
consequently excesses are just as little sinful. The religious views of
his parents, with which they sought to inoculate their son, also aided
to confirm the young man in his free-thinking opinions, as he was too
clever not to give the preference to an unfeigned belief in God. The
father incessantly told his incredulous son how he, from his youth up,
had felt in himself the most powerful workings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of grace, and was constantly tormenting him with other religious tenets
of a nature more or less abstruse. The mother, who had by her marriage
been only confirmed in the misty views she had imbibed from her father,
entirely agreed with her husband, and thus did her part to turn her
son against his home; and, lastly, the father's ill-applied strictures
hardened young Struensee's heart against all the exhortations of his
over-pious parents. The sermons which he was forced to listen to on
Sunday were powerless to produce any other opinion about religion.
He saw persons at church weeping from remorse, and found them after
the tears of pious repentance had been shed, no better than they had
been before. The result was, that Struensee, in opposition to these
hypocrites, became a perfect free-thinker.</p>

<p>Another trait of Struensee's character forms the keynote of his
catastrophe. He was from an early age gifted with an enterprising and
restless mind, and an unbridled ambition. This fact aroused in his
father a well-founded apprehension, when he heard of his son's rapid
progress in the world. "My son," he said to a friend, "will not be able
to bear the favour of his monarch." These words contain Struensee's
whole fate. Moreover, he had always an immoderate propensity for
pleasure, and very liberal views as regards morality. Such faults are
wont to assume enormous proportions in the intoxication of fortune:
they are the more dangerous for a man whose career attracts the general
attention; they lead him into serious errors; and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
statesman ought carefully to try and keep them in submission.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>With what remarkable abilities the young man must have been endowed
is proved by the fact that he was able to matriculate at the University
of Halle in his fourteenth year, and had not completed his twentieth
when he received his degree as Doctor. In 1757, the call of his father
to be chief preacher in the town church of Altona had a material
influence on Struensee's fate. The young doctor accompanied his father
there, and remained for a time in the house of his parents. Ere long,
however, he entered the public service, for, on October 20 of the same
year, he was appointed by the government town physician of Altona,
and country physician of the lordship of Pinneberg and the county of
Rantzau. When his father, who had become celebrated as a theologian,
was appointed by the government superintendent-general of the two
duchies, and removed first to Rendsburg and then to Schleswig, the
young doctor bought a house in Altona, and set up his own household.
His table was laid at dinner for six persons, at supper for four, and
the meals were accompanied by clever conversation. The host often gave
free course to his satire, though without offending any one, and his
guests were principally men of letters and officers.</p>

<p>In a small pamphlet I have picked up,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
curious anecdote, which serves to show the humorous side of Struensee's
character. He once invited to dinner four persons, all of whom he knew
to be on unfriendly terms. He delighted in the sour face cut by each
new corner on seeing his aversion, but tried to reconcile them. Each
of the guests whispered in his ear, "Why did you not tell me you were
going to ask them, and then I would have come to you another time?" He
laughed, and justly ridiculed an animosity which pedants are so fond of
keeping up. Another curious circumstance is, that two skeletons stood
by Struensee's bedside, holding burning candles in their hands. Whether
he really read at night in this anything but agreeable company in order
to habituate himself with death, cannot be positively asserted.</p>

<p>From 1760-62, Panning, a well-known literary man of the day,
lived with Struensee, and the couple started, in July, 1763, a new
literary experiment, called the "Monthly Journal, for Instruction and
Amusement." The first number is now lying before me; but there is
nothing very wonderful in it. It is supposed that an article, under the
heading of "Thoughts of a Surgeon about the Causes of Depopulation in
a given Country," was written by Struensee, because the essay contains
ideas which were afterwards set in practice by him. Although the
magazine contained various articles quite equal to the average of those
days, it was dropped at the end of six months, and when Struensee was
asked why he had not gone on with it, as it was generally popular, he
replied that literature did not pay. Afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
he published some medico-scientific treatises, and an essay on the
respect which an author ought to entertain for the public.</p>

<p>Struensee's studies and reading were not restricted to professional
topics. One of his favourite authors was Voltaire; but he also had a
great veneration for J. J. Rousseau. With Helvetius, he inclined to the
opinion, that as all men have equal organisms, they must be competent
to attain the same things, and this axiom he applied to himself through
the flattery of others. With Boulanger, he also assumed at that
time that fear of all mighty nature was the primitive source of all
religions among the ancient nations. Although Struensee never swerved
in his belief that the universe and the human race had their origin
in Deity, he could never be brought to the conviction that man was
composed of two substances. He assumed that God set human nature first
in action, but that when the machine ceased acting, <i>i.e.</i>, when a man
died, he had nothing more to hope or fear.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Struensee continued to work faithfully in his
profession. Some successful cures gained him a reputation, and as he
was sincere and frank, never condemned others or judged too severely,
he acquired numerous friends. His agreeable person and pleasant manners
helped to make him a popular physician, and we can quite understand
how the ladies selected the good-looking doctor to attend to their
maladies, real or pretended. After the fashion of the day, the ladies
had their little jests with him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
confessed, though always in a delicate manner, that he was an admirer
of the fair sex. When, however, persons tried to make him blush by
repeating to him some loose anecdote connected with himself, he always
blunted its point by displaying the utmost discretion.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
It is to be regretted that he did not follow the same good rule in the
awful crisis of his life.</p>

<p>Struensee soon gained access to the first houses, and found
a powerful patron in Privy Councillor Imperial Count Hans zu
Rantzau-Ascheberg.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This
count's son was Major General <span class="smcap">Schack Karl</span>, Count
<span class="smcap">zu Rantzau</span>, who became one of the principal actors in
the ensuing tragedy. He soon became intimate with the young doctor, and
they made an agreement that if either of them attained power, he should
help the other. They became the more intimate, because the doctor's
help was often needed for the accouchement of persons with whom Rantzau
had had adulterous intercourse. Struensee rendered these services with
a generosity far above his fortune; even more, he supported Rantzau for
some time, and advanced him the necessary funds to appear at court; so
that Struensee, instead of being the count's protégé, rather played
the part of protector. Rantzau, by his flattery, gave the doctor an
exaggerated idea of his capacity, and fostered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
in him the ambition which became his ruin. The count, however, only
thought of gaining a creature, and fully believed that if he ever
became again a great lord and general officer, Struensee would no
longer be his friend, but his client and physician. In the latter
capacity Struensee rendered him a signal service. Countess zu Rantzau,
while residing at Altona, was attacked by small-pox of a very malignant
character. All the Rantzaus combined in demanding that another
physician should be called in, but the husband insisted and declared
that his friend had genius, which was better than science. The disease
was very well treated, and the cure of the countess rendered the doctor
dear to all the family, their friends, and protégés.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Another house where Struensee met with a most friendly reception,
was that of the administrator of the county, Privy Councillor Baron
von Söhlenthal, who was the step-father of Enevold Brandt. Struensee
was also physician to the Landrost of the Lordship of Pinneberg, Privy
Councillor von Berkentin, whose wife, after the Drost's death, was
appointed chief gouvernante of the hereditary Prince Frederick. At
this house Struensee is stated often to have said, half in jest, half
in earnest, "My ladies and patronesses, only contrive to get me to
Copenhagen, and I will make matters all right." Struensee was also on very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
friendly terms with Equerry and Chamberlain von Bülow; and lastly, he
made at Altona the acquaintance of the then Captain Falckenskjold, who
was fated to suffer so terribly for this acquaintance, and of Count
Conrad von Holck, when the King of Denmark came to the duchies in
1767.</p>

<p>This period was probably the happiest in Struensee's short life, but
he found no satisfaction in his professional position. His restless,
soaring mind suggested to him to resign his post, and take a voyage to
Malaga or the East Indies. As his health at this time was not the best,
he hoped a recovery in a milder climate. The exciting details he had
read in descriptions of travels in India, and the prospect of acquiring
a fine fortune there, the more urged him to the enterprise, as he had
recently run into debt at Altona. At this moment a very different
prospect was offered him.</p>

<p>When a physician in ordinary had to be appointed for Christian's
projected tour abroad, Struensee was recommended by his patrons, Counts
Rantzau-Ascheberg and Holck and Brandt, who had not yet fallen into
disgrace, to occupy this post; and Frau von Berkentin, whose life
Struensee had once saved in a dangerous illness, and Von Berger, the
physician in ordinary to the king, supported this choice. Struensee
himself saw in this a happy dispensation of fate, which opened to him
an extensive career. He accepted the offer, and was appointed surgeon
during the journey on April 5, 1768. On June 6, he joined the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
suite at Ahrensburg, and had a seat in the carriage of Legations rath
Sturtz, with whom he eventually became very intimate.</p>

<p>During the entire tour Struensee, in consequence of his position,
was frequently near the king's person, and carefully watched over
his health. This often enabled him to work against the injurious
influence of Count Holck over the passionate prince, for which purpose
he generally had recourse to interesting conversation upon French
literature. On the other hand, Struensee carefully avoided political
discussions, and if ever such were brought up, he never made the
slightest allusion to home affairs. Struensee even carried this
precaution so far, that he either entirely broke off his correspondence
with his Holstein friends, or else restricted it to indifferent topics.
For the courtiers soon noticed the growing pleasure which the king
found in conversing with his doctor, and perceived that Struensee
possessed acquirements which fitted him to take part in other business.
But Struensee still clung to his profession too much to grant room to a
thought of giving it up, and was too sharp not to notice the suspicious
glances which the king's <em>entourage</em> cast at the interesting doctor.
Hence it was so little his object to overthrow Count Holck, that he
completely neglected an apparently favourable opportunity. We have seen
how Brandt was dismissed from court for his foolish letter to the king,
and ordered to retire to Oldenburg. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
had neither salary nor pension, Bernstorff gave him a supernumerary
post in the regency of that province. Growing tired of his employment,
Brandt went off to Paris to have an interview with the king, and
arrived just at the moment when Holck had fallen into temporary
disgrace. As Struensee did not move in the matter, Brandt obtained no
audience, and the favourite procured him 100 louis d'or to carry him
back again.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Struensee merely contented himself with weakening the immense power
Holck exercised over Christian, by encouraging his feeble master
to feel a greater pride in himself. As, too, Struensee never took
advantage of his position to obtain gratifications for himself or his
friends, he rose the higher in the respect of all persons whose respect
was worth having, with whom he came in contact in foreign countries;
and that the frivolous young king not only took pleasure in Struensee's
clever conversation, but also granted him a certain degree of respect,
he proved on every possible opportunity.</p>

<p>On January 7, 1769, Struensee returned to Altona in the king's
suite. As he had only been appointed surgeon for the journey, he would
have been obliged to resume his professional avocations, but the king
would have missed him too much; and hence, on the united proposition
of Bernstorff and Schimmelmann, he was appointed actual surgeon in
ordinary, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
a salary of 1000 dollars, while a gratification of 500 dollars
was granted him to pay his debts.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>On arriving in the capital, Struensee occupied himself for awhile
with his duties as surgeon. He employed the confidence he had acquired
with the king in drawing the young autocrat's attention to the state
of his health, arousing in him a liking for employment, and making
him lead a more regular course of life. He spoke with him openly
and fearlessly about everything that he considered right, although
he frequently discovered that he offended the king by doing so.
Such moments of displeasure were most marked, when he represented
to Christian the injurious results of immoderate sensuality&mdash;a
freedom which deserves the greater recognition, because Struensee at
that time had no powerful supporter at court, but stood quite alone.
For Count Holck had grown reserved toward him, and the only person who
displayed any attachment to him was the page Von Warnstedt, of which
Struensee took advantage to imbue this young man with principles which
would be beneficial to the king, should they happen to be repeated in
his presence.</p>

<p>On May 12, 1769, Struensee was appointed actual state councillor,
and was thus privileged to take part in all the court festivities, to
which only the members of the first three classes had admission.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
apartments in the palace of Frederiksberg, when
Christian VII. and Caroline Matilda resided there, in the summer of
1769. This enabled him to form acquaintance with all the personages
of the court, and study their character. When the king returned
to Copenhagen, the first signs of parties being formed began to
be visible, and that attached to Holck was the most important and
numerous. The first men of the state and the ministers belonged to it;
for they apprehended nothing from the frivolous favourite, who only
cared for pomp and pleasure: they were only afraid of the influence
of the reigning queen, and foresaw that she might become dangerous
to them, if ever she gained the upper hand. Holck confirmed the king
in principles which must excessively displease his consort and keep
her away from him: hence these men, whose only care was for their own
prestige and authority, could desire nothing more than the permanence
of the favour which Holck enjoyed. The few partisans of the queen
dowager shared with her the gloom and tranquillity of her present
state. A few young persons, who fancied they saw in the attractions and
good sense of the reigning queen a power, which might with time acquire
for her many partisans, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
under other circumstances regain the king's affection, seemed to take
her part; but they possessed no fortune, rank, nor the experience
which is necessary in court intrigues. The young queen also placed no
confidence in such weak supporters, and had already formed a plan by
which she hoped to attain her object.</p>

<p>Caroline Matilda had something active and decided in her character
which could not always lie fallow. She was greatly humiliated by the
insignificant part she played at court, and felt that there was no
other way of re-acquiring the respect which belonged to her rank than
by trying to gain the king's confidence again. She was convinced that
she would never succeed in this so long as Holck remained in favour;
and she could not make up her mind to place confidence in any one of
the ministers, as she felt a dislike of them all, but especially of
Bernstorff, whom she feared. She, therefore, determined to foil all the
offensive designs she apprehended from the ministers, and overthrow the
reigning favourite. To effect this, she began by displaying a marked
deference towards the king, and striving to act in accordance with all
his wishes. But she had not yet found the instrument whom she needed to
support her, till chance threw Struensee in her way. Up to this time,
the doctor had displayed no marked attachment to any party: Moltke's
partisans were striving to gain him and Warnstedt over to their side;
and as Struensee was a welcome guest at the house of the chief marshal
of the court, for which honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
he had frequently to pay, by losing heavy sums in the then fashionable
game of hazard, this coterie gained their object, or at least fancied
that they had succeeded.</p>

<p>Whether Struensee at this period of his career had an inkling of
the extraordinary part he would be called upon to play, it is now
impossible to say: it is evident, however, that he acted with the
utmost caution in feeling his way. He was gradually gaining ground
in the king's favour; but there is not the slightest evidence in
support of the commonly expressed opinion, that, with his first
step in Denmark, he resolved to become the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> ruler of that
country.</p>

<p>Various stories are current as to the way in which
Caroline Matilda and Struensee first became acquainted.
Her enemies assert that she was guilty
of dissimulation from the outset, and that, for some
time after she had chosen the doctor as her partisan,
she feigned an aversion for him; but there appears to
be no foundation for this report beyond that of party
spirit. After well weighing the various accounts, I
am disposed to accept, in preference, the one given in
Mr. N. W. Wraxall's private journal, because he had
it from one of the principal actors while the events
were fresh in his memory.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time, Struensee became intimate with a
lady whose sentiments seemed to harmonize with his
own. This was Frau von Gabel, wife of the admiral,
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">née</i> Countess Rosenkrantz, of Willestrup, in Jütland.
This lady, who was at the time only twenty-three
years of age, had formerly repulsed the king's
coarse advances. Struensee, in order to secure the
king's favour, thought it advisable, so it was said, to give
him an ostensible mistress, of whom he himself would
be the real lover.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> He chose for this purpose Frau von
Gabel, a very young and charming woman, animated
with a real patriotism, but too much of a republican
to live at court. Struensee began by persuading her
that the king had been entirely changed during his
tour; he had grown affable and attentive, and capable
of devoting his attention to governing. He added, that
he flattered himself with having greatly contributed to
this change; that the patriots ought to thank him for
it, but that the work was still imperfect, and could
only be completed by a woman of sense and honest
character undertaking to arouse in the sovereign a
moral feeling, which had been blunted by his debauchery
and the vices of his favourites.</p>

<p>Frau von Gabel, on hearing this, desired to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
better acquainted with the king, and to please him. She received
repeated visits from Christian during the early part of the year,
though she lived some distance from court. The clever lady strove to
employ the impression she produced on the king's mind in dragging him
out of the inaction which degraded him, and helping him to cast off his
inglorious bonds. Still Struensee did not agree with her on two points.
The first was, that she and the Moltke party insisted on removing Holck
from the king's person, which Struensee considered unnecessary, because
an old favourite was less injurious than a new one. The other was, that
she did not, like the doctor, regard a reconciliation between the royal
husband and wife as absolutely necessary for the king's happiness.</p>

<p>Frau von Gabel soon discovered, however, that she had been deceived
as to the king's pretended amendment. In proportion as he spoke
with less reserve, he displayed the same vices she had known in him
formerly, and, in addition, the mania which formed their basis. She
fell into a state of profound melancholy, and died in the following
August, showing, in her last moments, that Struensee, far from having
been her lover, had only attracted her hatred.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Caroline Matilda had discovered Frau von Gabel's
desire of pleasing the king, and, as a woman, naturally
placed a false construction on it. She regarded Struensee
as an accomplice; hated them both; and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
spoke of the doctor with the most supreme contempt. Holck behaved
like the engineer who hoisted himself with his own petard. Seeing the
queen's detestation of the doctor, he did his utmost to force the
latter upon her, and revelled in the idea of causing her increased
annoyance. Caroline Matilda was, at this time, melancholy and ill, and
was supposed to be affected with symptoms of dropsy. The remedies she
took had no effect either on her malady or her temper, and hence the
king proposed to her to consult his young doctor; and, on her refusal,
insisted on it. Struensee had even more knowledge of the human heart,
the world, and women, than of his profession. After observing and
questioning the queen, he assured her that she was not dropsical; that
her illness was not serious; and pledged himself to cure her in a short
time. His treatment was as agreeable as his diagnosis; and his promises
were consolatory.</p>

<p>"Chagrin," he said, "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, and a sedentary life, have produced
all the mischief; your Majesty does not want medicine so much as
plenty of exercise, amusements, and distractions. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ennui</i>, which
dwells in courts, principally arises from etiquette; the latter must
be proscribed, or, at least, restricted to certain days, which are
specially consecrated to it. Danish ladies do not ride on horseback;
but your Majesty must give them the example. They may be scandalised at
the outset, but the fashion and custom will make them regard the thing
with more favour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen took riding lessons, and became, in a short time, a good
and indefatigable horsewoman. The obstructions were soon dispersed, and
gaiety, recalled to court in proportion as etiquette was banished from
it, caused no apprehension of a relapse being entertained. This happy
cure acquired confidence and easy access for the doctor. The queen
soon saw that she had been unfairly prejudiced against Struensee. On
conversing him on various subjects, she found him better informed and
more agreeable company than the swarm of idlers and empty-headed fops
who surrounded her. She liked the doctor the more on discovering that
he was thoroughly informed of the cause of her sorrow. Nothing affected
her so much as the indifference of the king and the insolence of his
favourites. Holck had certainly tried to gain her favour; but whether
he set to work awkwardly, or that the aversion was invincible, he had
only irritated her the more by his tentatives. He was reported to have
boasted that he could have gained the queen's favour by rendering
homage to her charms, and his indifference was the cause of her
ill-will. This boast, of which he was accused, justly or unjustly, had
left ineffaceable traces, and convinced the queen that all the other
accusations brought against the favourite were true.</p>

<p>Struensee, on the contrary, was a servant of no consequence.
He offered his devotion; he assured the
queen that he should esteem it a happiness to employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
all his credit with the king in effecting a reconciliation. The
king had treated his wife, for some time past, with a respect and
a ceremonious tone that resembled derision. Struensee promised to
restore familiarity and confidence: results followed closely on the
promises; and he attached no value to this service. It was, he said,
his own interest he was studying; he felt quite comfortable in his
position; all he wanted was to acquire consistent support and the
protection of a person who could not be turned from him. The preceding
favourites had been very blind in trying to establish their credit on
the disunion of the married couple; for, in such a struggle, they must
necessarily succumb. Such interesting conversations naturally entailed
greater assiduity. The king appeared to approve of them, because they
rendered his own situation more agreeable; and the ascendancy he
allowed the queen to regain increased his own amusements. Far from
opposing Struensee's visits, he sent him to the queen at all sorts
of hours, with all sorts of messages, and invited him to every court
festivity.</p>

<p>Struensee zealously continued his efforts to reconcile husband and
wife, and as both placed more confidence in him daily, he was tolerably
successful: only in one thing did he fail, and that was in rendering
the queen better disposed towards Holck, whom she regarded as the
cause of all the evil, although the latter, who was beginning to feel
his influence decrease, tried, as far as lay in his power, to render
himself agreeable to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
In October their Majesties returned to the capital, and the good
understanding between them seemed continually to improve. The
influential doctor and family adviser now found an opportunity for more
extensive action, as, on January 17, 1770, a suite of rooms was given
him in Christiansborg Palace.</p>

<p>The usual court festivities began again in this winter season.
Theatrical performances, masquerades, balls, sleigh parties, and
cavalcades, alternated with concerts at Count Holck's palace. Although
the king took part in all these amusements, he appeared no longer to
find pleasure in them. He only went because he was requested to do
so, and in most matters let himself be guided by the will of others.
Just as on his return from abroad he gave himself up to Bernstorff's
guidance, he now only listened to what the queen or Struensee advised
him. The latter had hitherto remained in retirement, and only attended
to his professional duties and pleasure, until an unpleasant occurrence
attracted general attention to him.</p>

<p>Struensee was at the Opera, in the box set apart for the gentlemen
of the court, in which Filosofow also was. The unpolished Russian,
however, had a bad habit of expectorating frequently, and on this
evening spat on Struensee's coat. The latter dried it, and held his
tongue; but had scarce done so when Filosofow insulted him again in
the same way. Struensee began to murmur, but the envoy said it was a
mistake, and apologised. Struensee, not satisfied with this bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
apology, demanded satisfaction, and quitted the box.
But the Russian, instead of meeting his man, appealed
to his diplomatic position, and, on his side, demanded
satisfaction of Bernstorff, who, however, would not go
into the matter, but quietly allowed it to drop. We
can hardly assume that Filosofow had merely acted
in mistake in the box, and we can as little believe that
political motives caused his improper conduct, for Struensee
at this period had not mixed himself up at all in
affairs of state. It is more credible that the Russian
had been cut out by the good-looking doctor in a
love affair, and wished to take his revenge in this
coarse way.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Owing to this occurrence, Bernstorff
was warned by one of his friends against Struensee,
and advised to remove the doctor from the king's
person. The minister, however, did not listen to this
advice: his self-esteem concealed from him the true
position of affairs, and his pride despised an enemy
over whom a victory would be too cheaply gained.
Such negligence is the more surprising in Bernstorff,
because he had long before spoken freely to some
friends about the character of Struensee and his plans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and sufficiently proved that he had investigated his
rival's designs with his own peculiar shrewdness, and
drawn unpleasant consequences from them.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In this season Count Holck saw more and more clearly that danger
threatened him. He was only able to hold his own for awhile through
Struensee interposing on his behalf, although the latter openly
reproved his conduct, and through attaching himself to Reventlow,
Schimmelmann, and General Hauch. He regarded Struensee as his most
dangerous opponent, though, as we have seen, unjustly so. Still, the
doctor was beginning to make marked progress in his short career. He
had acquired the special favour of both their Majesties by the better
understanding he had produced between them, and the inoculation of the
crown prince, which he undertook on May 2, 1770, gained him the queen's
favour in a still higher degree.</p>

<p>The small-pox raged so fearfully in Zeeland in 1769, that in
Copenhagen alone twelve hundred children fell victims to it. The common
people, especially in the country, paid but little heed to the rules
laid down by the physicians, and the result of this negligence was,
that frequently more than one-half of those down with small-pox died
in a village. Jenner's mode of vaccination was but little known at
the time, and the establishment of a vaccinating dispensary was only
ordered in Copenhagen on December 1, 1769. It had not got into working
order when the crown prince was attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
by small-pox, and Struensee received orders to vaccinate
him. He undertook the task: the illness passed
over without peril, and the little patient was saved.</p>

<p>Caroline Matilda loved her boy most tenderly. Her good heart left
her no rest from the moment when he was attacked by a disease which was
of a very dangerous nature, in spite of all the experience of science.
No one was allowed to take the place of the affectionate mother by the
boy's bedside; she nursed him herself; she sat up with him, and awaited
the moment of his waking to hand him a draught to cool his parched
lips. Struensee assisted her in these maternal duties, for she would
not permit him to quit for a moment the darling of her heart. This
gave him an opportunity of passing many hours in the queen's presence,
and she found consolation and, ere long, pleasure in his society. Her
conversations with him became more confidential and important, and
Struensee could easily see that the time was at hand when she would
seek his alliance, and make him the confidant of all her designs.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>As a reward for curing the crown prince, Struensee was appointed
reader to the king, and cabinet secretary to the queen, with an
annual salary of 3,000 dollars, and, directly after, the title of
Conferenzrath was bestowed upon him. Although people were accustomed
at that day to see men who had powerful patrons overwhelmed with
titles, still Struensee's sudden elevation attracted the greater
notice, because he was of bourgeois origin, and had no noble
protectors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been frequently urged, though incorrectly, that the
acceptance of this title was an error on the part of Struensee. On the
contrary, it was indispensable for his object, because he derived from
it the advantage of accompanying the king on his travels, and could be
admitted to the royal table. Struensee was at this time as modest as he
was cautious, and had very wise principles as regarded his elevation.
It might almost be asserted that this caution formed part of his
character, and that the errors he eventually committed must be ascribed
to the circumstances in which he stood. The nature of the ambition that
impelled Struensee was too great and far-sighted to be satisfied with
mere trifles and insignificant privileges: he fancied he could see his
way to the highest post, and resolved to attain it. Countless obstacles
rose in his path, which must be removed; he had innumerable rivals
who must be overcome. Universal envy prepared for him the hardest
struggle, and in this he must conquer. He saw beforehand that he should
never succeed in his object unless he secured a powerful position at
court.</p>

<p>After Struensee had been appointed reader to the king, his access to
the queen was much facilitated; for, as he had but little to do for his
master, the queen frequently employed him. His visits became so long
and assiduous, his conversation so interesting, his services so real,
that familiarity gradually sprang up between them. Ere long, all the
barriers which august rank opposes to individuals fell in turn, and at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
when the favourite perceived that he had become necessary, and fancied
that he had inspired friendship, he ventured to pronounce that word,
and was very favourably heard.</p>

<p>"You require," he said to the queen, "to give your confidence; and
to whom could you better impart your sorrows than to your friends,
to those from whom you can expect succour, owing to their ascendancy
over the king? It is the misfortune of persons of your rank to have
no equals, and to live only among jealous people and valets. Mutual
services establish a species of equality between you and the persons
who are able to oblige you."</p>

<p>These remarks were true: they were founded on the experience of
the past: they were uttered by an amiable and insinuating man, and
addressed to a person already too persuaded; to a queen who detested
her rank. She unhesitatingly accepted the friendship offered her, and
the proofs she gave of her own became daily more marked. Conscious of
her innocence, Caroline Matilda behaved in a manner that caused people
to talk, and her conduct was certainly most imprudent. Struensee was
constantly seen in her company, and she granted him familiarities
which, as Reverdil says, "would have ruined any ordinary woman." She
gave him a seat in her carriage when they were in the country, and took
solitary walks with him in the gardens and woods. At the court balls he
was her constant partner, and when she rode out he was her favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
cavalier.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> No wonder that the scandal grew,
and was doubtless fanned by the ever watchful Juliana Maria. Had it
been a great nobleman, it would have been different, of course, but
Struensee, doctor, reader, and even raised to the second class by the
title of councillor, was not an officer of the court, and could hold
but one position, since he showed himself everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>As Holck did not dare to attack Struensee, he resolved to remove
Warnstedt from the king's presence, and fancied he had discovered a
good way of doing so. He proposed to the king to undertake another
pleasure trip to the duchies. It was his intention, and that of his
partisans, that the queen should not accompany her husband, so that
they might the more easily sway the monarch when his consort was
away from him. But Caroline Matilda had now more power than before
the king's first journey abroad: she resolved to go too,&mdash;and
Christian offered no objection. When the journey was definitively
arranged for the beginning of May, Holck effected the appointment of
young Herr von Hauch as page to the king, <em>vice</em> Warnstedt, promoted an
equerry and chamberlain. But the count's glee at this victory was of
but short duration, for in a few days the new page was obliged to quit
the court again, though for what reason remained a mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>The journey was appointed for June 6, at the latest, but the old
queen dowager, Sophia Magdalena, was taken ill on May 18, and died on
the 27th. During the last few years she had not exercised any influence
over her grandson, Christian, who was now doing his hardest to break
through all his old connections in the capital. Hence, the mourning
for the deceased queen was limited to the extraordinarily short
period of six weeks, and to the capital, while the court retired to
Frederiksberg, to escape the troublesome restraint. The departure for
the duchies, however, was, for the sake of propriety, deferred till the
funeral was over. The preparations were consequently hastened, and on
June 13 the corpse was deposited in the royal vault of the Roeskilde
Cathedral. On the 18th, their Majesties commenced their journey to
their German subjects.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that Struensee and Warnstedt were in waiting, and
Count Holck also accompanied the king. Of the members of the privy
council of state, only Bernstorff was present. Reventlow paid a visit
to his estates; while Thott, Moltke, and Rosenkrantz, remained in
Copenhagen to attend to current business, but with express orders not
to have any dealings with the foreign envoys during the king's absence;
and the latter were requested, in the event of any pressing matter,
to apply in writing to Count Bernstorff. The tour was in truth only a
little change for the king, who was growing daily more imbecile;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
but it was employed by the queen, Struensee, and their partisans, to
introduce the reforms they had secretly planned into the government.</p>

<p>Not one of the courtiers on whom Holck could reckon was in the
suite. It is true that his brother, Gustavus, his brother-in-law and
sister, the Von der Lühes, and his cousin, Von Lüttichau, were attached
to the court; but all these were only kept in place by his influence,
so that Count Bernstorff was the sole member of the Holck party left.
But the count himself was beginning to totter, so that he could only
keep his own position with difficulty, and was quite unable to support
others.</p>

<p>For some time past it had grown quite clear to Bernstorff that the
king did not regard him so kindly as formerly. He had drawn the queen's
displeasure on himself by aiding in the dismissal of Frau von Plessen,
and he justly regarded his colleague, Rosenkrantz, as an enemy, because
that intriguing gentleman had first aroused the queen's anger against
him. Lastly, Bernstorff was growing seriously alarmed about Struensee's
increasing influence and rapid advancement. Latterly, Filosofow,
probably instigated by revenge, had repeatedly urged him to remove this
dangerous man from court, and offered the assistance of the empress
in effecting it. But Bernstorff declined the offer, as he did not
consider the opposite party would be so bold as to attack a minister
of his reputation, whom even a Danneskjold Samsöe had been unable to
overthrow. Still, he requested Filosofow, who was on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
visiting the baths of Aix-la-Chapelle, to go only as far
as Pyrmont, so that he might be at hand should his
assistance be required.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Among Struensee's partisans, Von Warnstedt appeared to have the
greatest influence over the king. Chamberlain von Bülow also seemed to
have some power over him, but not nearly so much as his colleague. But
on this occasion Caroline Matilda had joined the travelling party, and
had become the chief personage, through the king's growing weakness.
She was also of opinion that no peace could be thought of so long as
Holck was suffered in the king's presence. Although Struensee no longer
regarded the king's former intimate as dangerous, still, to pacify the
queen, he proposed to her to recall two gentlemen from banishment who
had formerly been esteemed by the monarch.</p>

<p>On June 13, the count arrived at Gottorp Castle, in the town of
Schleswig, which had been occupied since 1769 by the king's favourite
sister and her husband, the viceroy of the duchies, Landgrave Charles.
The latter drove out a league to meet their royal relations; and
the meeting was most cordial, especially between the queen and her
sister-in-law, who had not met since Caroline Matilda's marriage. The
king, too, seemed at first greatly pleased at the meeting; spoke a good
deal with the landgrave, and at dinner invited him to come as soon as
he could to Copenhagen, as many of the Holsteiners would follow the
example of their viceroy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
But the court soon assumed a more earnest character during the few days
they remained at Gottorp. Weighty changes were preparing; the ground
was shaking under the feet of many great gentlemen; and Struensee's
power had already grown so great, that he was able to carry out the
recall of Brandt to court, which took place here.</p>

<p>We have seen that page Enevold Brandt, after his banishment from
court and the country, paid his respects to the king in Paris, but
derived no particular advantage from the step. In the next year, 1769,
however, on the queen's birthday, he was nominated titular chamberlain,
and soon after received a post and a vote in the Oldenburg government.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Bernstorff and
Schimmelmann, who had always favoured Struensee, took Brandt's part
too; and even Holck is said to have solicited his appointment in a
distant land. But he was not prepared for Brandt's return to court
circles, and he was greatly surprised on unexpectedly coming across
his old opponent at Gottorp. Brandt, noticing this, turned to Holck
with the sharp remark: "I fancy, my lord count, that you are afraid of
ghosts (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">des spectres</i>)?" To which Holck gave him the bitterly true
answer: "Oh non, monsieur le chambellan, je ne crains pas les spectres
mais les revenants."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>It was noticed with regret by the queen's friends
during this journey, that she seemed to forget the
noble self-respect and attractive modesty which adorned
her even more than her beauty; and that she indulged
in sports and amusements which only too easily thrust
those virtues in the background. Her youth knew no
caution, her good heart rendered her careless of the
opinion of the world, and her lively temper made her
leap over barriers which she ought never to have
crossed, if her reputation had been dear to her.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Prince Charles, her brother-in-law, gives us a melancholy
account, in his "Mémoires de mon Temps," of
the deleterious influence Struensee was already beginning
to exercise over her. Still, it is only fair to remember,
in quoting the landgrave, that he was a bitter
enemy of Struensee:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After an hour's conversation (on arriving at Gottorp),
in which we recalled anecdotes of past times,
the queen took me by the arm and said: 'Lead me
to the cabinet of Princess Louisa, but do not make me
pass through the ante-chamber in which the court is.'
We almost ran along the corridor to the back door by
the side of the staircase, when we saw some of the
suite coming up the stairs. The queen noticed Struensee,
and said to me before the door: 'No, no, no; I
must return; do not keep me.' I remarked to her,
that I could not leave her alone in the passage. 'No,
no, no; return to the princess:' and she fled along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the passage. This struck me greatly; but I obeyed.
She was always embarrassed with me when Struensee
was present. At table he was always seated opposite
to her."</p>

<p>Further on, we read of another humiliating scene:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The king's dinner was dull. The queen afterwards
played at quinze. I was placed on her right,
Struensee on her left; Brandt, a new arrival, and
Warnstedt, a chamberlain, completed the party. I
hardly like to describe Struensee's behaviour and the
remarks he openly dared address to the queen while
leaning his arm on the table, close to her. 'Well,
why don't you play? can't you hear?' (Nun, spielen
Sie doch, haben Sie nicht gehört?) I confess my
heart was broken to see this princess, endowed with
so much sense and good qualities, fallen to such a
point, and into such bad hands.... The
king and queen went to Traventhal with the whole
court, who had followed them to Gottorp. My wife
and I did not join the party, nor was it proposed to
us to do so, for Traventhal was chosen for the least
decent orgies. They had only been there a few days,
when the whole court was dismissed."</p>

<p>At Traventhal the king and queen remained a
month; and it was here that the foundation was laid
of the state edifice which Struensee had resolved to
raise. He believed that he possessed the requisite
ability to do so; and he was supported by the favour
of his royal patrons. But he was deficient in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
most important qualities,&mdash;the necessary caution to
be observed in such daring designs, and personal courage
in carrying them out.</p>

<p>Brandt's appearance at Gottorp was merely the introduction
to his brilliant career of two short years,
for he was soon after re-appointed to the Supreme
Court, and, at the same time, made director of the
French plays, the Academy, and the picture gallery.
Struensee, Von Warnstedt, and Brandt, had, from this
time, a decided influence over the king. The only
thing remaining to do was to recall to court Count
Rantzau-Ascheberg, the second of the two men upon
whose assistance Struensee specially calculated to carry
out his reforms, and whose recall he had proposed to
Caroline Matilda, for the queen was afraid lest the
ministry might attempt to restore Holck in the king's
favour, by removing those persons who now stood in
the favourite's way.</p>

<p>But it did not even need Rantzau's assistance to
overthrow Holck; for, in addition to the queen's dislike,
he had to contend against Brandt and Warnstedt's
open hostility; and even Struensee, who had, on
two occasions, induced the king to make his extravagant
favourite a gift of 10,000 dollars, was obliged to
join in the cabal. But what dealt the final blow in
Holck's downfall was the fact that the king was tired
of his former favourite, because his weak state of
health did not allow him to take part in the pleasures
usually arranged by Holck. At the same time, Holck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
had taken Brandt's letter but little to heart, and constantly
neglected his duties, especially in the summer
of 1769, when he spent several days at his summer
house, revelling with actors and actresses, without
thinking of his functions as marshal of the court.</p>

<p>Toward the end of July, Count Conrad von Holck
was dismissed from his office with a pension of 2,000
dollars, and his fall was followed by the removal of his
sister, Frau von der Lühe, from her post as first lady-in-waiting
on the queen. At the same time, Conferenzrath
von der Lühe, Privy-Councillor von Holstein,
Gustavus von Holck, Chamberlain von Lüttichau,
Lady-in-waiting von Eyben, and the Maids of Honour
von Trolle and Von Wedel, were ordered to return to
Copenhagen. This order attracted considerable attention,
though it was stated that the royal family intended
to stay some time in the duchies, and the
castle was not large enough for a numerous suite.
Still, these were merely court incidents, which could
have no effect on the state, but ere long other occurrences
happened which related to public affairs. The
first of these was the appearance of Count Shack zu
Rantzau-Ascheberg on the political scene.</p>

<p>This gentleman, one of the principal performers in
the coming tragedy, was descended from the oldest
family in Holstein. His father, who had been raised
to the dignity of Count of the Empire, in 1728, by
the Emperor Charles VII., possessed the large estates
of Ascheberg and Breitenburg in Holstein, Lindau and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
others in Schleswig. His son, Shack Karl, was born
on March 11, 1717. At the age of eighteen, he was
captain in an infantry regiment, and afterwards removed
to the Grenadiers. In 1746, he became a chamberlain;
and after being attached, in 1750, to the crown prince's
regiment as brevet colonel, he was promoted to be full
colonel of the regiment in 1752. In the following
July he was appointed a major-general, but dismissed
two days after.</p>

<p>Rantzau went to France, and served under Maréchal
de Löwendal; but, one fine day, he left his regiment
in order to attach himself to the car of an Italian singing
woman. During his amorous odyssey, he passed
through all sorts of adventures, and assumed all sorts
of shapes, like a veritable Proteus. At one time, he
appeared with all the splendour becoming his birth
and condition; at another, he lived at Rome in a
monk's gown. For some time, he remained <em>incognito</em>
with a troupe of comedians. During this career he
often ran short of money, and at times procured it
how he could. He was tried criminally in Sicily for
swindling; and, at Naples, the French envoy had to
hush up an ugly matter in consideration of his family.
At Genoa, he impudently drew a bill on his father,
"the Viceroy of Norway," though his father was only
a plain country gentleman, and had turned him up
long before.</p>

<p>In 1761, on the death of Elizabeth, when a war was
anticipated between Russia and Denmark, Rantzau had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the impudence to offer his services to Peter III. as a
Holstein gentleman who had a right to serve his duke.
His offer was spurned, and Rantzau swore revenge.
He wormed himself into the confidence of the Empress
Catharine and Count Orloff; and was mixed up
in the conspiracy against Peter III. As he was coldly
treated, and passed over instead of being rewarded when
Catharine ascended the throne, he returned to Holstein
very angry, and brooding over revenge. It was at this
period that his fatal connection with Struensee commenced,
as we have seen.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of Frederick V., Rantzau acquired the favour of
Count St. Germain, who was omnipotent at court; and the latter procured
him the rank of Lieutenant-General in 1766, and, in the following year,
the chief command of the Norwegian army. He behaved in a very reckless
manner, and was suddenly dismissed from active service in 1768, after
Bernstorff and Saldern had succeeded in removing St. Germain from his
post as generalissimo of the army and head of the War Office.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
After this, Rantzau returned to Holstein, where he inherited the family
estates, on the death of his father, in 1769.</p>

<p>Through his marriage with the eldest daughter of
his uncle, Count Rantzau Oppendorf, Count Shack had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
taken a step by which to unite the estates of the two
families; but he led a most licentious life, which resulted
in a divorce, and his poor wife fell into a state
of melancholy bordering on mania. All sorts of gallant
adventures had entangled him in duels, and he
had killed several of his opponents. A respected man,
whose daughter he seduced, also challenged him, and
was shot by him. Rantzau was inconsolable at this,
begged the widow's forgiveness on his knees, married
her seduced daughter with the left hand, and settled a
large annuity on the mother and her remaining children.
But time and fresh love affairs removed the
impression which this sad event had made on the gay
gentleman, and he soon returned to his former licentious
life. His extravagance was so great that he was
said to have lit his pipe with 10-dollar notes at some
gay parties. But he was a very kindly landlord to his
serfs, so that they positively adored him, and venerated
him as a father.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Though the negotiations for this man's return to
court were kept very secret by the queen's party, they
did not escape Bernstorff, who saw the black clouds
that announced his fall continually drawing nearer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
The premier was sincerely attached to the Russian
court, and had in his day effected Rantzau's downfall.
Hence he addressed the king in writing, and called his
attention to the displeasure which Rantzau's recall
would arouse in Petersburg. The contents of the letter
were imparted to Rantzau, who, in consequence, promised
not to interfere in the negotiations with the
Russian court about the exchange of provinces. As
Bernstorff could no longer prevent the count's return
to the service of the state, he exerted himself to reduce
the ill-impression it must produce in Russia, and thus
the last obstacle was removed from Rantzau's path.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Rantzau, during his residence at
Petersburg, and through the part he played there, had
an opportunity to learn secrets and witness actions
which enabled him to regard the Russian court from a
point of view which it desired to conceal eternally from
the sight of the world. This was the reason why the
Russian empress could never forgive Caroline Matilda
and her adviser Struensee for recalling this man to
favour.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>While the king and queen were at Traventhal, Rantzau
was introduced to them, and had the honour of receiving
a visit from them at Ascheberg, where he did everything
in his power to divert his exalted guests. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
day had its special festivities and amusements: music,
hunting, fishing, sailing on the lake, and rustic sports,
which, more than any other pastime, pleased the imbecile
king. The queen, fully satisfied with the respect
that Count Rantzau had shown her, and little dreaming
of the share her attentive host was to have in her fall,
gave him a superb snuff-box set with brilliants, which
had cost her husband a thousand guineas in London.</p>

<p>All the efforts made to amuse Christian met with
but slight success, for he seemed to be sunk in thought,
and everything that went on around him, the numerous
changes of situation and persons, no longer
produced any interest for him. The effects of former
excesses on his frail constitution became but too evident,
while his mental abilities only shone forth now
and then in the shape of satire. One day, at Traventhal,
when Christian had been bothered with signing
the commissions of a number of new conference councillors,
and the matter was talked about at dinner, the
king turned to his favourite dog, Gourmand, lying at
his feet, and said, "Can you bark?" And when the
dog, on whose paws Christian trod, began barking and
growling, his master said, "Well, as you can bark, you
can be a conference councillor too;" after which he
rose from his seat, and proposed the health of the new
Councillor Gourmand, to which the whole court responded,
in accordance with etiquette. Not satisfied
with this, the king insisted on the same salary being
paid Gourmand as his human colleagues. This joke
was a bitter pill for Struensee's pride, for the Holck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
faction continually addressed the dog as <cite>Conferentie
Raad</cite>, in mockery of the favourite's new-horn honours.</p>

<p>The recall of Count Rantzau-Ascheberg to court on the part of the
queen and Struensee was only carried out, in all probability, in
order to secure their own position and that of the new household.
According to Reverdil, the latter was very badly selected; two ladies
of notorious gallantry, Von Bülow and Von Gähler, were appointed
in waiting, and the manners of the court were of such a free and
easy nature, that even old Rantzau was surprised at it. "When I was
extravagant," he said, "everybody else was respectable; now that age
has regulated my heart and my conduct, everybody has gone mad. I fell
with a great man, and return with a few scamps." Struensee had, in
truth, already commenced his deplorable system of rendering the court
bourgeoise, and keeping the nobility aloof. He forgot that in this way
he increased the number of his enemies. Up to this time, however, the
favourite had formed no settled plan of action against the ministry.
The queen herself had not the slightest wish to mix herself up in the
affairs of government, and even though Struensee possessed sufficient
self-confidence, and felt himself strong enough to overthrow Bernstorff
and the old noble party in the council of state, he was still uncertain
about the consequences of Rantzau's return, as he was well acquainted
with his ambition. But long before his appointment at court, Struensee
had been prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
against the government, and had probably just heard from Rantzau
and Brandt reports, in whose trustworthiness he could rely. What he
afterwards witnessed in Copenhagen only confirmed what he had heard.
The principal charge he brought against the ministers was, that
they purposely sought to turn the king against any participation
in government business, by producing unnecessarily dry and formal
documents, and drawing up the papers laid before him for decision in
a diffuse and perplexing manner. They rarely left the king a choice
between two alternatives; but persuaded him to sanction the resolution
on which they had decided beforehand.</p>

<p>All those persons who took an interest in the king
and gained his confidence and attachment, were systematically
removed from him, and only those whom
he disliked retained their posts. The highest offices
were given through favour and intrigues to courtiers,
whose sole merit consisted in the fact that they had
been pages, while appointments of less value were bestowed
on the lackeys and domestics of those in authority.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The whole condition of the kingdom was becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
an anarchy; for no one dared to exert his authority
through the fear of injuring himself. Every official
strove to gain influence beyond his own sphere, and
subordination hardly existed. The state finances were
ruined, mostly through want of order in the administration
and improper use of the revenues of the state.
For many years past, the influence which foreign
powers had exerted over the government through
their envoys, had been excessively great and oppressively
felt, although a counter pressure had been attempted
by costly Danish embassies. Lastly, public
affairs and the general welfare suffered from the great
number of large and small officials, and a regular trade
was carried on in titles of honour and distinctions.
It was, consequently, very natural that Struensee
should try to effect improvements, so soon as he felt
his own position sufficiently secure to enable him to
attempt the necessary reforms.</p>

<p>It is equally certain that similar ideas were entertained
in another quarter; for, during the king's
journey, general plans for reforming the administration,
and the necessary steps for overthrowing the
present council of state, were discussed by General
von Gähler, who had a seat in the College of War, and
Count Rantzau. The private correspondence carried
on between them contained some thirty feigned titles
for persons mentioned in it; for instance, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le silencieux,
la bête</i>, and so on. Holck was probably meant by the
last honourable title. General St. Germain, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
living in retirement at Worms, was also let into the
secret, as the common friend of Rantzau and Gähler,
and informed of the state of the secret negotiations.
Struensee, it is true, did not consider any one of the
ministers as specially to blame for the bad administration;
but Bernstorff was universally regarded as the
most powerful man in the state, and was personally
detested by Rantzau. That Bernstorff, after the return
of the royal pair from Ascheberg to Traventhal,
was not invited to dinner, was doubtless done with the
object of irritating him, and urging him to send in his
resignation. This hope, however, was not fulfilled.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Holck and his party was a terrible
warning for the premier, and he discovered too late
how incautiously he had acted, and how dangerous
his position had become. The support of Russia appeared
to him the only chance of salvation; he therefore
informed Filosofow of all that occurred, and the
latter hastened to him at once. But the time of his
prestige was gone, and he only arrived to be an
humiliated witness of the triumph of his worst enemy.
Past was the time of the Russian authority over the
Danish court: when the mere threat of stopping the
territorial exchange set the king and his ministers in
the greatest alarm: when an omnipotent Saldern
raised and overthrew the servants of the Danish court
in accordance with the interests of his own, enjoyed
honours which had never been granted to a foreign
envoy, and carried through the king's tour against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
wishes of all his ministers. Past, too, was the day
when a haughty Filosofow wrote directly to this weak
monarch, when the latter wished to give an important
command in his army to Count von Görtz, a friend of
Count St. Germain: "I have orders from my court
to quit yours, and break off all intercourse, sooner
than allow this dangerous and intriguing man to enter
your service." Struensee, whose influence was beginning
to spread over all the affairs of court and
state, had inoculated the king with very different
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>During the residence at Traventhal, Caroline Matilda
presented a pair of colours to her regiment quartered
in the fortress of Glückstadt, whose commander
was Rantzau. The presentation of these colours occasioned
a military festival; and, in remembrance of it,
the king ordered his painter, Als, to paint an historical
picture, representing the queen in life-size in the uniform
of a colonel of her regiment. On the 16th June,
1771, this picture was given by the queen to Count
Rantzau, and is probably preserved by the family as
an historical souvenir.</p>

<p class="p1">THE QUEEN'S FRIEND.</p>

III.&mdash;THE CABAL&mdash;THE WAR WITH ALGIERS&mdash;THE PALACE OF
HIRSCHHOLM&mdash;FALL OF THE PREMIER&mdash;PROPOSED REFORMS&mdash;STRUENSEE'S

<p>On June 9, 1770, the Dowager Princess of Wales
set out with her son, the Duke of Gloucester, and a
numerous retinue from Carlton House <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> for the
Continent. As this was the first time during thirty-four
years that her royal highness had quitted England,
her departure gave rise to the wildest conjectures
among her opponents. As mystery and policy
were imputed to all her motives by the so-called liberal
party, her declaration, straightforward though it
was, that she was going to visit her brother and her
daughters, was not believed. Some said that she was
going to meet Lord Bute, while others expected that
some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d'état</i> was about to be carried out during
her absence, to which she might plead not having
been privy. As the Duke of Gloucester accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
her, more charitable persons supposed that she was
trying to break off his liaison with Lady Waldegrave;
others, or the uncharitable, declared that the princess
was displeased with the increasing powers of the queen,
her daughter-in-law, while others again supposed that
she was conveying her treasures out of the country for
safety.</p>

<p>The resolute old lady cared little what was said
about her, and, though she was hooted as she passed
through Canterbury, I dare say her feeling was,
"laudatur ab hiss." She was allowed to embark
quietly at Dover, and, much to Walpole's affected
surprise, no bonfires or illuminations took place in
London in honour of her departure. The princess
ostensibly wanted to see her daughter, the Princess of
Brunswick, probably for some little family intrigue;
but the journey was really intended to the address of
Caroline Matilda. Some good-natured friend had told
George III. an exaggerated story about his sister's
conduct; and this, together with the political crisis
which was preparing in Denmark, led to the Princess
of Wales's journey. In those benighted days it was
considered of the utmost importance by English ministers
that Bernstorff should remain in power, because
he was devoted to Russia, and thus prevented a Gallo-Danish
alliance.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the Princess of Wales and her
daughter should meet at Brunswick, and the ducal
court made great preparations to receive the exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
guests worthily, but at the moment when the King
and Queen of Denmark were expected, the grand
marshal arrived with news that Queen Matilda was
unwell and unable to travel. I can hardly think that
her illness was of a very serious nature, or lasted any
length of time. The court usually played cards at
Traventhal till midnight, and were out riding by five
in the morning, for the days seemed too short for
pleasure.</p>

<p>However this might be, the Princess of Wales
would not be disappointed, and proposed a second
meeting at Lüneburg, a town much nearer Denmark
than Brunswick was. The King and Queen of Denmark
arrived, their suite only consisting of Struensee
and Warnstedt, who were seated in the carriage with
them. They arrived late and tired; when the princess
addressed her daughter in English, a language which
Struensee did not understand, the queen pretended
to have forgotten it. The conversation was cold and
constrained; they retired to bed at an early hour, met
again at eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and parted again in the afternoon.
Caroline Matilda did the civil thing by asking her
mother and brother to pay a visit to Copenhagen, which
was declined politely, and they never met again.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Horace Walpole, who reminds me greatly of Father
Holt, in "Esmond," who wished to be supposed omniscient,
but was every now and then detected in
some jumbling details which destroyed his claim to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
authenticity, describes the interview between mother and daughter with
as much circumstantiality as if he had been present. He says, that when
the princess lamented the fall of Bernstorff, the old servant of the
family, the Queen of Denmark said, "Pray, madam, allow me to govern my
kingdom as I please." Unfortunately for the story, Bernstorff had not
yet been overthrown. However, I dare say that some conversation did take
place about the premier, and that Caroline Matilda showed her hand too
openly.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales returned to England, after requesting Mr.
Woodford, her son's minister in Lower Saxony, who was at Lüneburg, to
seek an opportunity for insinuating a portion of what she had intended to
say to her daughter. Another minister, who passed through Copenhagen on
his way to Sweden, having been intrusted by the King of England with some
remonstrances for his sister, was not admitted. This monarch, also, wrote
the most earnest letters: the first was very coldly received, and the
rest not even read. We see that everybody had entered into a conspiracy
to misunderstand Caroline Matilda's motives, and attribute the lowest of
causes to her intimacy with Struensee; even her own family, who should
have known her better, believed that in so short a time she had forgotten
the lessons of her youth, and would not see that she was forced into her
present position, because her pride would not allow her to be dictated to
by the ministers, and insulted by foreign envoys. Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
she selected the only man as an ally whom she
thought she could take without danger, she was accused
of forgetting her marriage vows, and no one
would give her credit for more exalted motives. Had
George III. been able to draw a distinction between
the lover and the friend, he should have rejoiced at
the intimacy between his sister and Struensee, because
the latter was determined to break the power of Russia
in Denmark; but he was a man of low birth, and naturally
such a person could only be favoured by a
queen through the very lowest of motives.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Perhaps,
though, in those days when virtue was considered a
most troublesome attribute, King George can hardly
be blamed for the opinion which he formed of his
sister's conduct. In fact, the king's own truthfulness
and rectitude were very injurious to Caroline Matilda.
He believed what he was told, and remonstrated with
his sister instead of examining into the reports more
closely, while she, naturally offended that her brother
dared to insult her by entertaining such suspicions,
neglected all prudence, and rendered the breach between
them irreparable.</p>

<p>From Lüneburg, the royal couple hastened back to
Copenhagen, and proceeded, on August 24, to the
palace of Frederiksborg. This palace, which was
burnt down in January, 1860, was the Versailles of
Denmark, and erected by Christian IV. from 1606-1620.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
It was built on three small islets connected by
bridges, in a lake, and the chief wing so completely
covered this island, that it seemed to rise directly from
the water. In one of the state rooms leading to the
royal closet in the chapel, Caroline Matilda wrote
with a diamond, upon the window, the touching words,</p>

<p class="center">"Oh, keep me innocent, make others great."</p>

<p>The country around the palace is remarkably fine,
and the drives and walks through the forest are beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
It is not surprising, therefore, that the queen
should make it her favourite residence, owing to her
love of exercise and privacy.</p>

<p>That the residence of the royal couple at Traventhal
was not devoted to frivolous orgies, as the enemies of
the queen and Struensee, and even her princely brother-in-law
at Gottorp asserted, has been sufficiently
proved. On the contrary, the time was employed in
meditating the mode of carrying out great reforms,
though what extent they would have depended on the
future. The condition of the king was now of such a
sad nature that he helplessly signed the orders laid
before him for his assent. Struensee was the only man
who was still able to make the king form a resolution
by his quiet remarks, and the stay at Frederiksborg,
away from the seat of government, was purposely
selected, in order to carry through the reforms already
arranged with the queen, without any external opposition,
and to bring them to the knowledge of the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Count Rantzau-Ascheberg had, in the meanwhile,
preceded the returning court, and arrived at Copenhagen
by August 14. Two days after his arrival in
the capital, he was appointed third deputy of the War
Department. It can hardly be believed that he had
done so much to obtain so little: indeed, it had been
at first arranged that he should be placed at the head
of this department by the retirement of his two seniors,
but one of them was Gähler, the husband of the pretty
and docile woman who had become so necessary at
court, and the other was an old friend of the queen.
Rantzau also retained the command of the queen's
regiment, and was likewise appointed on the 29th of
the same month commandant of Glückstadt, though he
remained in Copenhagen. Still, it was a great error
on the part of Struensee to have placed so ambitious a
man as Rantzau in such a subaltern position, and it
proved that he possessed but little common sense or
knowledge of the human heart. In politics it is wrong
to be ungrateful, and more especially to be so by
halves. After what had passed, Rantzau could no
longer remain indifferent, and a man of that character
does a great deal of evil or a great deal of good.
Therefore, he ought to have been appointed minister,
or else exiled.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, however, a man reappeared in
the capital in whom the opposite party fancied they
had a support against Rantzau. This was Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Chevalier Michael Filosofow, who had just
been appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary of Russia. He had arrived three
weeks previously in Hamburg, but had not hurried to
reach Copenhagen, probably because he did not expect
much from a speedy return to the capital. In the
latter case he was perfectly right: for in the present
state of affairs the most speedy return would have
been too late for him and his designs.</p>

<p>In order to furnish a just idea of the reforms which
Struensee undertook, it is necessary to take a glance at
the state of Denmark at the period when he assumed
the administration. Before the war against Charles
Gustavus, King of Sweden, the government of Denmark
had been a thorough oligarchy, much like that
of Poland. The chief power was vested in the hands
of the nobles, or of a senate composed of their representatives,
and entrusted with their interests: the crown
was elective, and the king had no authority but what
the senate left him. The clergy had lost their power
and wealth through the Reformation. An almost absolute
despotism weighed on the citizens of the capital
and the other towns, though their deputies figured as
a species of third estate in the diets of the nation: the
country people, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">adstricti glebæ</i>, were divided among the
noble landowners like herds of cattle, and were employed
by them to till the soil.</p>

<p>In 1660, the citizens of Copenhagen, who had just
repulsed the Swedes from their walls, took advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of their momentary strength to change the government;
they abolished the senate, rendered the crown
hereditary, and by a solemn treaty unreservedly handed
over the whole power to their king, Frederick III.,
both for himself and his heirs for ever, hoping, doubtless,
that the yoke of a single master would be less
oppressive than that of a caste of nobles.</p>

<p>Frederick III. regulated the absolute power with
which he was invested, and in order to compensate the
nobility in some measure for what they had lost, he
called to him the most considerable of them and formed
them into a privy council, which was, as it were, the
image of that senate by which the nation had been so
long governed. But his successor, Christian V., gave
his entire confidence to Schumacker, the son of a wine
merchant, who governed Denmark skilfully under the
title of Count von Griffenfeldt, and this system was
continued even after the favourite's fall.</p>

<p>Under the following reigns, as the sovereigns still
suspected the nobility of their country, they summoned
foreigners into their service; and as this policy was
persisted in, foreigners gradually seized on not only
the home and foreign offices, but even the most considerable
civil and military posts. These foreigners,
not having any relatives or friends in the country, and
not being always able to obtain subordinates from
abroad, chose their confidential agents among their
most devoted servants, and procured them advantageous
posts as a reward, or else to secure them as partisans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
This example was soon followed by the natives; and
just as in ancient Rome the power fell into the hands
of freed men, lackeys became in Denmark influential
personages, who did not limit their ambition to subaltern
employments.</p>

<p>In proportion as foreigners and people in their service
assumed a greater share in the government, offices,
appointments, and pensions were multiplied; and under
the specious pretext of benefiting the interests of
the state or the public, a multitude of establishments
were erected, with the requisite officers to manage them
and perform the different duties. Some served the
prince, others managed the finances and crown lands,
or entered the army, the police, or the law. There
were establishments for the relief of the poor, for the
advancement of the arts and sciences, education, agriculture,
trade, and manufactures, and they were required
for everything.</p>

<p>Just as the state displayed its luxury in land and
sea forces, at foreign courts and at home, each branch of
the administration had also its abundance of officers,
registrars and clerks. Still, beyond certain limits, it is
impossible to endow new officers without trenching
on the salaries of the old ones: hence it happened that,
in excessively increasing the number of clerks, the
wages of the majority were reduced to the most
moderate rate. As money ran short, recourse was
had to titles and honorary distinctions, the etiquette of
each rank being settled with the minutest details, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
well as the respect or deference attaching to it. When
it was decided that rank and titles conferred by the
government should receive the honours and consideration
due to merit, there was an eager rush to
obtain them. The tradesman left his counter, the
artisan his shop, the plain citizen gave up his modest
livelihood, in order to acquire a title and become somebody.
This vanity, penetrating all classes, gave a
great impulse to luxury and ostentation.</p>

<p>Government was not chary in granting a largess that
cost it so little. It accorded titles to favour: it gave
them as reward for services, and even sold them.
Rank soon ceased to be exclusively attached to office,
and more than once encroached on the principles of
military subordination. Thus, an officer in the army
would take precedence of his commander, and bring
the rules of discipline under those of etiquette. Still,
it appeared that the profusion of titles, far from inspiring
disgust, strengthened the mania for them:
men were ashamed not to have what so many people
possessed.</p>

<p>Eminent titles, such as those of Count or Baron, retained
a portion of their privileges: those who held
them could not be arrested for debt, and they found at
their manors an asylum against criminal prosecutions
until sentence was passed. These estates, which were
partly free from taxes, could not be confiscated even
for high treason, and were transmissible by inalienable
succession from eldest son to eldest son. These noble
landowners exercised the rights of high and low jurisdiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
on their estates, and these privileges recalled
the olden times of lordly rule. But nothing recalled
it so much as the serfdom which continued to oppress
the class of peasants, and the militia duties appeared
to double the burden.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must allow that this numerous and
interesting portion of the population was not quite
forgotten. In each district, a bailiff administering on
royal account either the lands taken from the clergy
at the Reformation, or lapsed feudal estates and the
other domains of the crown, had among his other
duties that of hearing the complaints of the peasants
against their lords, and protecting them against oppression.
But the bailiff could not always be found at
home, and was not always disposed to compromise his
own interests in sustaining those of the peasants.</p>

<p>A portion of the woes of Denmark evidently resulted
from these old institutions; and many of the abuses
would have sprung up without the interference of
foreigners. Besides, it is indubitable that there were
men of merit among the foreigners called in to govern
the country: but the best intentioned nearly all committed
the error of trying to introduce a system successfully
carried out in other countries, without considering
that it agreed neither with the wants of
Denmark nor her resources; in this they resembled a
farmer who plants exotics in his fields, instead of cultivating
those suited to the ground and the climate.</p>

<p>In this way, academies of science and fine arts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
established at Copenhagen, in imitation of the nations
farthest advanced in civilization. Under the ministry
preceding Struensee, learned men had been sent at the
king's expense to the East, for the purpose of studying
its monuments and antiquities, as if Denmark were in
a position to make such sacrifices to satisfy curiosity:
thus new trades were introduced, new manufactures
undertaken, without consulting the resources of the
country and the merchants, and they had no other
effect but impoverishing the Treasury. In the same
way money was squandered in sending envoys to look
after interests unconnected with the country; and
following the example of powerful nations, armaments
were made, intended to be imposing, but which, being
disproportionate to the real strength of Denmark, only
served to prove her weakness.</p>

<p>Although the state had enjoyed uninterrupted peace
since 1720, the errors of the administration had produced
the effect of a cruel war: the debt of 20,000,000
of dollars was tending to increase instead of diminishing.
The burdens that oppressed it not only prevented its
strength from developing, but seemed daily to weaken
it. It languished like a robust body, threatening to
fall into a state of atrophy, because unable to perform
its natural functions freely. A species of constraint
was felt from the throne down to the lowest classes,
and reforms seemed to be invoked by the public voice.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal family remained for ten days at Frederiksborg,
but this short stay was rendered remarkable
by the first appearance of a royal message without
the adhesion of the Council of State or other administrative
authorities. As it is notorious that this message
was proposed to the king by Struensee, the latter's participation
in the government is generally dated from
this period. The message contained various regulations,
bearing the date of September 14, and was of a
very important nature. The first related to the future
restriction in granting titles. We read in it that the
number of persons who had, during the last year, been
granted titles on festal occasions, or through recommendation,
had grown so enormously large that distinctions
of this nature had ceased to be a reward for services, or
a proof of special royal favour. Hence the king had
resolved to grant such distinctions, in future, more
sparingly, and only for their real purpose. Henceforth
regard would solely be had, in such cases, to faithful
performance of duties, zeal and diligence in office, and
special abilities. Government officials, who recommended
persons for honorary distinctions, would be
responsible that no undeserving person obtained them.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The writer and suggester of this proclamation certainly
deserved the thanks of his contemporaries; and
all sensible persons were pleased at this message from
their sovereign. The second decree referred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>quarrel then going on with the Dey of Algiers. A
commission was appointed, consisting of Count Rantzau-Ascheberg,
Lieutenant-General von Gähler, Vice-Admiral
von Römeling, and the Schoutbynacht (Rear-Admiral)
Hoogland, whose duty it would be to inquire
whether Algiers could be taken, or the city so injured
that the dey would be compelled to make peace, or
whether satisfaction must be extorted from the piratical
prince in some other way. The appointment of this
commission entailed an investigation into the conduct
of Admiral Kaas and all the promoters of the unsuccessful
expedition against the piratical state, which had
cost Denmark 2,000,000 dollars. A few words about
this strange affair may be advisable here.</p>

<p>The Dey of Algiers, though he was quite absolute,
or, perhaps, from the fact of his absolutism, was obliged
to humour his army and keep it in good temper. The
troops, who lived principally on plunder, were very annoyed
at the truces, or treaties of peace, concluded with
nearly all the maritime powers. The tribute which
the nations of second rank consented to pay, in order
to buy the safety of their commerce, represented the
prince's share of the plunder; but the soldiers insisted
on having a nation given up to them every now and
then, as a compensation for their trade depression.
Sieur Oerboë, the Danish consul, not having been able
to take the right steps, on the expiration of his treaty
in 1769, for its renewal, the dey gave him orders to
withdraw in three days, and all the subjects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
king in six weeks, alleging as motive that the Danes
had favoured the Russians in their war with the Sublime
Porte, and had abused the safety granted to their
flag by protecting the trade of hostile nations.</p>

<p>The Copenhagen cabinet began by negotiating at
Constantinople; and it was settled with the Porte that
Denmark should send an expedition which would intimidate
the troops of Algiers, and prevent them from
murmuring at the facility with which the dey revoked
his orders; and that at the same time, in order to contradict
the rumours of the pretended aid to Russia, the
Danish squadron should have on board a messenger
from his highness, bearing instructions to the dey
to renew the peace. Bernstorff, who had been the
founder of the Danish Levant trade, and was naturally
very proud of his bantling, intrusted the embassy
to Vice-Admiral Kaas, who had performed, a few
years previously, a similar commission to the Emperor
of Morocco in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Bernstorff proposed to Count Laurvig, the head of
the Admiralty, that the squadron should be composed
of three men-of-war, two frigates, and two bomb-ketches;
and Laurvig, without consulting with his
colleagues, decided that this force was sufficient. As
Denmark possessed no bomb-ketches, merchantmen
were purchased and fitted up for the purpose, which
considerably delayed the expedition; and Kaas was
not able to leave the Baltic till 1770. On arriving
off Algiers, he first hoisted a white flag, and the dey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
sent off a Christian consul to ask what he wanted. He
answered that he demanded peace, reparation for injuries
inflicted on his nation, and the expenses of the
expedition. The envoy from the Porte, who was
landed, was hardly listened to, because he spoke on
behalf of a master who was engaged elsewhere, and
who was not feared. The negotiation being at once
broken off, Kaas began throwing shells into the city,
and firing at the batteries, but with so little effect,
that the Algerines, in mockery, brought their children
down to the beach to fire pistols in reply to the Danish
bomb-ketches. After throwing in seventy-four shells,
the admiral held a council of war, in which he showed
that the ketches were too weak for the duty; that the
seams were beginning to open; that the vessels would
suffer more harm from the guns of the forts than they
inflicted on the ramparts; and it was unanimously decided
that they must retire to Mahon and refit.</p>

<p>The most important of the cabinet orders issued,
however, was the one that abolished the censorship,
and rendered the press perfectly free. The king&mdash;such
was the reason given for a decree which entailed
terrible consequences&mdash;was of opinion that it was injurious
to the impartial examination of the truth, and
prevented the uprooting of antiquated errors, if honest-minded
patriots, who felt anxious about the general
welfare and the true benefit of their fellow-citizens,
were unable to express their views and convictions
openly through the press, assail abuses, and show up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
prejudices. Hence his Majesty had determined to
introduce unbounded freedom of the press in all the
countries beneath his sceptre, so that, henceforth, no
one would be obliged to subject books and pamphlets,
which he intended to print, to the previous examination
and opinion of the censor.</p>

<p>There is but little doubt that Struensee, in passing
this law, hoped that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gent écrivassière</i> would take
advantage of it to abuse Bernstorff, whose downfall
took place almost simultaneously. Unfortunately, the
weapons were turned against himself, for the Danes,
constitutionally prone to stand on ancient customs,
disliked the innovations, and, above all, that they were
introduced by a German. One great cause of offence
was, that the decrees emanated from the royal cabinet,
and cabinet orders were a rarity in those days; but,
indubitably, the chief annoyance was felt at the decrees
being drawn up in German, which language was henceforth
employed in all public proclamations. For, although
German was the language of the court and the
nobles, royal orders, which did not concern the duchies,
had hitherto always been drawn up in Danish.</p>

<p>Before the royal pair left Frederiksborg they were
present at the Copenhagen shooting festival, which
honour had only been bestowed on the citizens before
by Queen Charlotte Amelia, consort of Christian V.
Caroline Matilda, however, granted the company an
even greater honour, by firing a shot herself and hitting
the popinjay, in which her consort attempted to imitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
her, but made a grand miss. While the queen gained
many hearts by her condescension, she aroused quite
as much anger by her free and easy manners. She
appeared at this feast in male clothing, sitting her horse
like a man, which created great scandal among the
females. She did so, however, by the special request
of her husband, who hated ceremony, and, according
to his peculiar mania, liked his wife to display her
beautiful form. It is certain that riding <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en homme</i>
soon after became the prevalent fashion among the fine
ladies of Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>This was one of the long series of errors that Caroline
Matilda committed in her short career. Indeed, ever
since she had become intimate with Frau von Gähler
and the other light beauties who formed her court, a
great change had taken place in her, and a defiant recklessness
of public opinion grieved her best friends, and
was a terrible mistake in so puritanical a country as
Denmark. The priests took advantage of the popular
feeling, and many a sarcastic allusion to Jezebel could
be heard from the pulpit. Of course, the freedom of
the press found a splendid opening in abuse of the
queen and her supposed minion, and the capital was
soon flooded with the most scandalous attacks on the
couple. Ere long, caricatures, in which the queen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
her Cicisbeo were represented in the most ignoble postures;
satires, in which the most disgusting scenes
were described, were spread about the city, and not
merely pasted on the walls, but even in the passages of
the palace.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The court next proceeded to Hirschholm for the
summer. This palace, only a few miles from the capital,
was the most magnificent of all the royal residences
in Denmark, and has been described as the
"culminating point of the luxury and magnificence
that sprang up in the reign of Louis XIV." Adorned
externally with all the nicest French refinements in
gardening and pleasure-grounds, it dazzled the eye
within by the profusion of solid silver intermingled
with mother-o'-pearl and rock crystal, with which not
only pictures and looking-glasses, but even the very
panels of the audience-chamber, were prodigally encircled.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
According to the "Old Chamberlain," this
palace was built by Sophia Magdalena, who demolished
the celebrated old castle, and erected a new palace in
the middle of the lake on many thousands of piles
driven into the ground, which was formed of mould
brought from a long distance. A large iron gate,
standing open, between high stone pillars, formed the
entrance to a wide alley laid out upon a dyke, leading
across the lake to the palace, which was connected with
the land by this avenue only, and occupied the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of the square island in the centre of the lake. Above
two low ranges of building rose a broad Italian wing,
with a flat roof in the form of a balcony, and in the
middle of it a prodigious gate tower, terminating at
top in a pyramid, supported by four lions couchant,
and surmounted with a royal crown. Through this
gateway could be seen a quadrangular court, in which
a fountain, adorned with marble figures, threw up its
jets. Two large pavilions, at the two extremities of
the balcony wing, connected this with the side wing
and inner main wing, while two bridges, one on
either side of the palace, communicated with the gardens
and stables. The inner wing had windows toward
the palace yard, as well as toward the south side
of the garden beyond the lake, which was very wide,
and separated the palace from the gardens. Two narrow
gravel walks, at the foot of the broad flight of
stone steps, ran along the walls of the palace.</p>

<p>In the gardens was a summer-house, which was used
as a temporary theatre for the diversion of Queen Matilda
and her companions; and in another part was a
wooden building called a Norway house, containing
landscapes in relief and imitations of rocks, with wooden
cottages perched on them, and wooden roads. In the
gardens were numerous fountains, and the dining-room
was also remarkable for a jet d'eau and twelve fountains
which spouted from the sides.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>The style of living at Hirschholm matched with the
splendour of the interior. The usual number that sat
down to dinner at the king's table was twelve, alternately
five ladies and seven gentlemen, or seven ladies
and five gentlemen. The king cut a wretched figure
on these occasions; but the queen dressed very superbly,
and made a noble appearance. The king and
queen were served on gold plate by noble pages; the
marshal of the palace sat at the foot of the table, the
chief lady of the household at the head; and the company
opposite to their Majesties.</p>

<p>A table of eighty covers was provided every day in
the chamber called the Rose, for the great officers of
state, who were served on silver plate. At this table
Struensee, Brandt, and their friends and favourites,
male and female, used to dine. The courtiers paid
Struensee more homage than they did the king, and
even in these early days of his prosperity it was noticed
that he was growing haughty and imperious; but it
would have needed a stronger head than he possessed
to withstand the influences of his sudden change. But
a few years before he had been seriously thinking of
going across the ocean to better his fortunes, and now
he was a confidential intimate of royalty, and honoured
with the too favourable consideration of an amiable
and accomplished queen.</p>

<p>While the court was at Hirschholm, the measures
were taken to liberate the party of the new era from
their dangerous opponent, Count Bernstorff. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
some time past the premier had seen the efforts made
to induce him, by insult or coarse allusions, voluntarily
to retire; and he had seen equally clearly that his reception
from the king was growing more and more
cold. He asked himself the question, whether he
should anticipate his fate or await it. He chose the
latter course, and soon after gave occasion for still
greater zeal on the part of those who were preparing
his overthrow. Without heeding Rantzau's promise
not to interfere in the Russian negociations about the
exchange of territory, Bernstorff expressed himself
in a report to the king rather freely about the opponents
of the negotiation, and as Rantzau at once
learned the fact from Struensee, he resolved to be
avenged. It may be assumed that the doctor had
some share in the count's dismissal, and indeed he did
not deny it afterwards. But he was in an awkward
position, for though he disapproved of Bernstorff's
policy, the latter had been his benefactor. The king,
however, was easily persuaded to dismiss his minister,
as he had never liked him.</p>

<p>On September 13, 1770, the king wrote an autograph
letter to Bernstorff, in which he thanked him
for past faithful services, but at the same time intimated
that, in consequence of intended changes in
the system of government, he no longer required his
advice, and therefore dismissed him with a pension of
6,000 dollars. Bernstorff was seated at his writing-table
when this letter was handed to him. He read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the contents in silence, and then rose with a look of
pain. To Councillor of Legation Sturtz, who was
present, the count said calmly, "I am dismissed from
office," and added, with his eyes raised to heaven,
"Almighty, bless this country and its king!" On
October 3 he quitted the capital, accompanied by
Klopstock, who was residing with him. Bernstorff
thought that the most suitable place to which he could
retire was his estate of Borstel, in Holstein, which had
come to him through his wife, and where he allowed
his mother-in-law, Frau von Buchwold, to reside.
He had always been received there with open arms,
whenever he had found time to escape from business;
and such had been the case in this very year. As the
château was large, and could contain several families,
he sent an upholsterer to get two rooms ready for him.
Frau von Buchwold turned out the upholsterer, and
refused to receive her son-in-law, who, through his
facile generosity, had given up his own house to her.
The disgraced minister spent the winter in Hamburg,
and the following summer at his château of Wotersen,
in Lauenburg.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Bernstorff's fate aroused general sympathy. It is
true that he had fostered the extravagance of the
court, favoured foreigners, and repeatedly allowed the
state to be swindled by projectors. Nor could he be
acquitted of a certain vanity; but still he was a man
of noble character, and honestly desired the welfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the state. He had sacrificed a large portion of his
fortune in the service of his adopted country, and the
prospect of a permanent peace with Russia was his
work. The incorporation of the ducal estates of Plön,
when this line died out, with the royal portion of
Holstein, was owing to his exertions; he had materially
raised the prestige of the kingdom at foreign
courts, by carrying through the profitable free trade,
and creating a maritime trade in the Mediterranean
and the Levant. He was a true father to the poor,
and hence we can understand that the whole nation
regretted his fall, and that general respect accompanied
him on his departure.</p>

<p>Bernstorff's post as minister of foreign affairs was
not immediately filled up. For this reason, the ministers
of the foreign courts were requested to address the
king directly in writing in matters concerning their
courts. The real object of this was to prevent the
Russian ambassador, Filosofow, from causing the king
to alter his mind through personal representations. The
intention did not escape Filosofow; he became terribly
excited, and vented his anger in the bitterest complaints
and remarks. He openly threatened the vengeance
of his court, and sent off at once by a courier
a full account of the remarkable events he had
witnessed in the course of a few weeks.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Bernstorff's discharge was followed by a great
number of others. The first blow fell on the father-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of the ex-favourite, chief secretary at war, and
intendant of the navy, Admiral Danneskjold Laurvig,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
a man who was universally despised, and consequently
not a voice was raised against his dismissal. His post
was not filled up, but Vice-Admiral Römeling was appointed
first deputy of the Admiralty College, with immediate
reference to the king. In the War Department
important changes also took place. Lieutenant-General
Von Hauch lost the presidency, which was
given to Gähler, and Rantzau-Ascheberg was promoted
to be second deputy. In the College of Finances,
Privy Councillor Shack and Count Gustavus
Holck were dismissed, and their post was given to
Von Scheel. In the two War Offices a number of dismissals
and promotions also took place.</p>

<p>These changes principally affected individuals, but
the new Regent did not stop with these, and it became
more and more clear that he intended a thorough reform
of the administration. But no comprehensive
and connected scheme was drawn up. Conferenzrath
Struensee read, as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lecteur du roi</i>, letters and proposals
for reforms to the king, which he recommended for
further consideration and resolution, but he consulted
no one else about his views. The king, himself, then
decided in Struensee's presence what should be done,
and how carried out. At times Struensee laid before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the king proposals drawn up by himself, which Christian
either sanctioned or altered, but wrote his own
orders himself. Conferenzrath Schumacher drew up
these orders in an official form, and the king read
them all through once more before he affixed his signature.
It was clear that the monarch chiefly listened
to Struensee's propositions, and equally certain that
the bases of reforms in the administration emanated
from the latter. The more important of these reforms
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>All representations addressed to the king must be
in writing, and the kings decisions would be given in
the same way. At the same time persons would be
careful so to draw up the petitions, that they only
contained the material points, and the questions on
which the king had to decide must be plainly and
clearly brought forward. In cases where the king
might find it necessary to consult with other persons,
he would either request the opinion of the college in
question, or appoint a commission to investigate the
matter, but everything, as far as was possible, should
be settled by the ordinary government organs&mdash;the
departments. The colleges would strive, as far as the
matter allowed, to treat and bring forward all affairs
in a similar form. As the king in deciding on matters
did not wish to enter into details, but expected it to
be done by the colleges, the latter would urge their
subordinates to attend to this duty and make them
responsible for it, so that all government business
might be treated in a similar mode. Lastly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
business of the several departments would be so kept
separate, that each would only attend to those matters
which naturally fell to it, and none would have an influence
over the other. The number of departments
would, moreover, be reduced, so that there would be
only one department for each division of the administration.</p>

<p>As regards the different branches of the administration,
the following rules were laid down concerning
foreign affairs: the king had resolved to strive
after no further influence over foreign courts in any
matters that did not affect the position of his own
kingdom and the prosperity of trade. At the same
time, the king wished to spare the expense which
numerous first-class embassies at foreign courts entailed.
On the other hand, the king would not allow
foreign courts any influence over the internal affairs
of his kingdoms. Although Struensee could not thoroughly
convince himself of the importance of the Holstein
territorial exchange for the Danish monarchy,
he was still of opinion that the king must remain true
to the Russian alliance, and create no suspicion at the
court of Petersburg. However, the Russian court must
not seek guarantees in accidental and immaterial circumstances,
but solely trust to the rectitude of the
king, of which he had lately given the empress the
most manifest proofs. As regards these ticklish relations
Struensee entertained very different views from
Rantzau-Ascheberg, who was of opinion that Denmark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
should not lean exclusively on Russia, but draw
nearer to other courts, especially the Swedish.</p>

<p>As regards Sweden, Struensee, speaking through
the king, entertained wise and peaceful sentiments.
These were, that the court should get rid of the disquieting
idea that Sweden was necessarily the enemy
of Denmark, gradually retire from officious interference
in the affairs of that kingdom, and, before all,
not expend such large sums upon it. Struensee was
also of opinion that France should no longer be treated
with the coldness which had set in when she gave up
subsidizing Denmark, and attempts be made to regain
her friendship. The French and Swedish envoys, Marquis
de Blosset and Baron von Sprengtporten, were the
only foreign ministers who paid respect to Struensee
during the period of his grandeur, and the only envoys
who appeared at his levees.</p>

<p>When the arguments on these points were ended,
the king read through everything that had been urged
by the two advisers of the crown, and decided in favour
of Struensee, though he had previously had no
fixed opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>As regards home affairs, it was decided that everything
connected with the finances of the state should be
placed under one college. Order and economy were
recognised as the sole means of relieving the embarrassed
finances, and all enterprises not based on those
two principles were given up. The whole of the state
revenue would be paid into one exchequer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
requisite sums paid out of it to the other departments,
so that the king might more easily see the state of
his income and out-goings. As a relief for the subjects
and the tax-gatherers, the payments in kind would
be converted into payments in money, in order to promote
the industry of the country people, and prevent
the frequent abuses which so often occurred in payments
in kind. The king wished the out-goings for
the government to be kept quite distinct from the
private expenditure for the court and royal family.
Factories, which, owing to their nature and the
circumstances of the country, could not exist without
assistance, would no longer be supported by the Treasury,
and the support of others would be given in the
shape of premiums, as the king wished to have no
partnership in them; and the same would be the case
with commerce. All pensions which appeared excessive
in proportion to the royal income would be reduced.
As regarded the administration of justice, the
king would not decide in any matter till it had been
legally discussed by the courts. The number of courts
would be reduced, as everybody, no matter his rank,
would be regarded as a simple citizen in judicial matters.
The judges would receive no fees, but have
a settled salary from the Treasury, and trials would
take place more rapidly.</p>

<p>General St. Germain had effected such excellent
reforms in the army, that the king in council proposed
to make no change in it, although the system of recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
among the natives had not yet been introduced.
For the navy, the sensible regulation was established
that its strength did not consist in the number of vessels,
but in those already existing being fit for sea and
properly equipped. It was also of importance that
everything required for a bombardment should always
be kept in store. As regards the court, every superfluity
that only served for pomp would be removed,
and only that intended for amusement retained, but
it must be borne in mind that the amusements and
court circles would be arranged in accordance with
the taste of the king and queen.</p>

<p>In addition to these general rules for the future
administration, there were several maxims which
Struensee often repeated to the king, and tried to
imprint on his weak memory. The principal of them
were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was injurious to foster the flocking to court of
persons who hoped to make their fortune there, for it
only tended to ruin such persons, to impoverish the
country, and entail losses on the king's Treasury. It
would be better for the nobility to live on their estates
if they did not desire employment, and those who
wished for an official appointment must render themselves
fit for it in subordinate posts.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Exceptions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
this rule should only occur for valid reasons, and not
through favour or a lengthened residence at court.
In giving appointments, the king must trust to the
recommendations of the colleges, and pay no regard
to the requests of courtiers or patronage. The king
must issue no decree by which the privileges of citizens
were attacked. His Majesty also, at least during the
first years, must grant no distinctions or titles that
did not agree with the office held by the recipient.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Pensions must only be granted in extraordinary cases,
and after long service, and no alms were to be bestowed
on courtiers, but all the more copiously on
those who really needed them. The king must strive
to make Copenhagen great and prosperous, not by
luxury and numerous consumers, but by industry and
foreign commerce, so that capitalists might be attracted
to the capital. Improved morals could not be
produced by police laws, which were an encroachment
as well on human liberty; for immoral conduct, if it
have no immediate injurious influence on the quiet
and safety of society, must be left to conscience to
condemn. The secret vices which force and oppression
entailed were frequently much greater offences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
against morality, and constraint only generated hypocrisy.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that such a system of government,
in many respects, agreed with the principal
wants of society and the country at that day. Still
it must be carried out without precipitation, with
caution, and a thorough knowledge of the country and
the national character. Two points in this advice to
the king deserve comment, however. In his opinion
about the nobility, Struensee showed himself to be a
man who had but slight confidence in himself, and
was more competent to form great schemes than carry
them out. A statesman displays his weakness when
he shows a fear of that class of his fellow-citizens who
are able to weigh his actions properly. In the hands
of a wise regent and a clever minister the service of
the nobility must be the principal support of the state,
and not the object of ignoble apprehension. As regards
Struensee's views about morality, and its influence
in the welfare of the state, he was one of those
sciolists who derive their principles neither from reason
nor virtue, and who, under the deceptive mask of
respect for the rights of society, give admission to the
utmost irregularity.</p>

<p>The general overthrow, which had not spared any
class of officials, and had hurled the highest of them
from office, aroused an indescribable alarm in every
mind. The queen dowager quietly watched this terrible
storm from a distance: her dissatisfaction at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
was as uncertain as it was of little consequence; she
merely made a point of meeting those persons, on
whom the ruinous blows had fallen, with the greatest
expressions of sympathy and friendship on every occasion.
In the meanwhile, the young queen and her
adviser enjoyed the advantages they had acquired; the
confidential union and peace in which they lived was
heightened by the most agreeable amusements, and
their happy days were passed in undisturbed delight.
Still they did not forget to insure the permanency
of this state of things, and followed a very cleverly-devised
plan. Struensee, whose far-sighted schemes
aimed at getting the whole royal authority into his
hands and the queen's, felt that this was impossible
so long as the power was not brought into one hand,
and that hand must be the king's.</p>

<p>The king was certainly an absolute ruler, but there
was a serious obstacle to the proposed scheme in
the traditional respect felt for the council of state,
which had grown, as it were, into a law of custom.
Through Bernstorff's fall the council had certainly received
a shock, but the earnest Thott, the experienced
Moltke, and the clever Rosenkrantz, were still members
of it, and possessed numerous partisans. The
privy council aroused a certain degree of reverence,
both because it was established on the introduction of
absolutism into Denmark in 1660, and because it had
always consisted of members of the highest aristocracy.
Hence it seemed a serious matter to abolish it all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
once, and Struensee, therefore, resolved upon an expedient.</p>

<p>After Bernstorff's dismissal the privy council was
not called together for eleven days, and on September
24 a royal rescript to the following effect was sent to
its members. As it was the king's wish, the rescript
ran, to have the council of state organised in the best
manner, he requested that on the first occasion of
their usual meeting they should properly consider the
matters laid before them, and leave the final decision
to his Majesty, for the privy council, in a monarchical
state, was intended to offer the king all possible assistance
in governing. With respect to this, the king
expected the members of the council of state ever
to reflect that in a sovereign state like Denmark the
narrowest limits must be given to subordinate authority,
so that there might be no encroachment on the
sovereign power, which was solely represented by the
person of the king. The privy councillors must therefore
never forget that the king did not grant them any
power of decision in any matter that was ventilated,
and much less any legislative and executive authority,
and that the council of state was merely established
in order to place the matters intrusted to it for consultation
in a clear light, and lay an opinion before
the king. Hence, in judicial matters, no appeal to the
privy council would hereafter be permitted, and the
Danish and German chanceries would henceforth report
directly to the king, as would the departments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
foreign affairs and the finances.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The privy council
would meet once or twice a week, and when important
matters had to be discussed the king would preside in
person, but in his absence the council would send in a
report in writing about its session to the king.</p>

<p>About this period the salt tax was repealed, which
had produced great dissatisfaction among the poorer
classes, and even caused an outbreak in the island of
Bornholm. The abolition of this tax was effected at
a time when government had heavy extraordinary expenses
to defray on account of the expedition against
Algiers. But Struensee, who, in spite of all his faults,
always thought of alleviating the necessities of the
poor, considered this tax, which only oppressed the
lower orders, so unjust, that he proposed its immediate
abolition. Ere long, other reforms followed.</p>

<p>Although in most of the other Protestant countries
the excessive number of religious holidays had been
done away with, they were still kept in Denmark and
the crown lands, and were spent in idleness and excesses.
In consequence, there appeared, on October
26, a decree, which abolished the previous three days'
holiday at Christmas, Easter and Whitsuntide, Twelfth
day, St. John's and Michaelmas days, All Saints, the
Purification, Visitation and Transfiguration of the Virgin
Mary, and the annual Te Deums for the repulse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the attack on the capital on February 11,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and the
great fire of October 23. This regulation caused great
annoyance among the large clique of pietists, who considered
the Christian religion deeply injured by the
abolition of superfluous holidays.</p>

<p>On the same day a second cabinet order appeared,
which purposed to prevent the filling up of offices of
state by favour and simony, as it was desired that future
candidates should have their abilities subjected to a
strict examination.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that it was all work and no play at
Hirschholm. The queen became about this time excessively fond of hunting,
and the court, magnificent in everything, kept up three establishments;
and for each of these there was a very costly uniform. That for the
king's stag hunt was a buff coat with light-blue collar and cuffs; the
coat was trimmed all round with silver lace, and lined with blue; the
blue waistcoat was also laced; the breeches were of leather; and the
cocked-hat laced, with a black cockade. The uniform for the hare hunt was
a green velvet coat and waistcoat, leathern breeches, brown top-boots,
and cocked-hat with green cockade. The falcon or hawk hunt uniform was
the most magnificent of all, being crimson velvet, with green cuffs and
collar trimmed with gold lace, leathern breeches, gold-laced cocked-hat,
and green cockade. Matilda, when she hunted, was attired, I am sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
to say, exactly like a man. Her hair was dressed with less powder, and
pinned up closer, but in the usual style, with side curls, toupet, and
turned up behind; she wore a dove-colour beaver hat with a deep gold
band and tassels, a long scarlet coat faced with gold all round, a buff
gold-laced waistcoat, frilled shirt, a man's neckerchief, and buckskin
small clothes and spurs. She looked splendidly when mounted and dashing
through the woods, but when she dismounted the charm was, to a great
degree, dispelled, for she appeared shorter than she really was; the
shape of her knees betrayed her sex, and her belt seemed to cut her in
two.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>But when Caroline Matilda was dressed in the
manner becoming her sex, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incessu patuit dea</i>, she was
every inch a queen. She had grown much taller and
stouter since her arrival in Denmark, and any one who
had not seen her for the last four years would hardly
have recognised her. She was always gay and tasteful
in her dress, and combined a happy mean between
London and Paris fashions. Her complexion was exquisitely
fair, and it was a disadvantage to her beauty
that the fashions of the day obliged her to hide the colour
and texture of her fine silver tresses under a load of
powder and pomatum. The best description of Caroline
Matilda I have met with, and one which exactly
corresponds with the portraits of her that I have seen,
will be found in a work published in Denmark a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
years ago, which, though in the form of a novel, bears
evident traces of being what it represents to be&mdash;the
"Recollections of an Old Chamberlain:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Over a marble table hung a portrait in a broad
gilt frame. It represented a lady in a dress of bluish
satin, embroidered with gold and edged with lace, the
sleeves and puffs over the full bosom being of brownish
brocade. Round her neck was a closely-strung necklace
of pearls, and similar rings were in her ears. The
hair was turned up and powdered; it occupied a
height and breadth which, agreeably to the fashion of
the times, exceeded that of the whole face, and was
decorated with a gold chain, enamels and jewels, entwined
with a border of blonde, which hung down
over one ear. The face was oval, the forehead high
and arched, the nose delicately carved, the mouth
pretty large, the lips red and swelling, the eyes large,
and of a peculiar light blue, mild, and at the same
time serious, deep, and confiding. I could describe
the entire dress, piece by piece, and the features trait
by trait; but in vain should I endeavour to convey an
idea of the peculiar expression, the amiable loftiness,
or lofty amiability, which beamed from that youthful
face, the freshness of whose colour I have never seen
surpassed. It needed not to cast your eye upon the
purple mantle, bordered with ermine, which hung
over her shoulder, to discover in her a queen; she
could be nothing of inferior rank. This the painter,
too, had felt, for the border of the mantle was so narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
as to be almost overlooked. It was as though he
meant to say: 'This woman would be a queen without
a throne.' But she was more," the author adds;
"she was an angel, and the Danes still cling with
affectionate regard to the memory of the lovely being
thus portrayed."</p>

<p>Although I do not believe entirely in the accounts of
the orgies at Hirschholm, as described by the author of
the MS. in "Northern Courts," I cannot help allowing
that much happened there which offered cause for regret.
The old court had been austere and devoted,
the new one became futile and impious, as the preachers
called it. Sunday had been in former times given to
the Lord, and the Saturday employed in preparation
for it; but now these days were purposely selected for
pleasure. As if this were not enough, Brandt was
guilty of the inconceivable folly of ascending the pulpit
of the palace chapel and delivering an absurd sermon
to the assembled court. As a fresh amusement,
Equerry von Warnstedt got up horse-races, at which
the king offered a prize of 600 dollars. All this
folly naturally strengthened the game of the queen
dowager, who, though she kept quiet, was incessantly
on the watch for her opportunity.</p>

<p>While the royal family were residing at Hirschholm,
the training of the crown prince was a subject of discussion
between the queen, Struensee, Berger, and
others. The boy, who was now nearly three years
of age, had a weak constitution and a tendency to
consumption. He was obstinate; given to screaming;
would not walk; insisted on being constantly carried;
and attached himself to certain persons. He would
never play by himself; he had to be scolded in order
to make him be quiet, and wanted people to be continually
singing and dancing to him.</p>

<p>The following methods were employed to overcome
the boy's weakness:&mdash;He was given very simple fare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
consisting of vegetables, rice boiled in water, bread,
water, milk and potatoes, but all cold. At first, he
was bathed twice or thrice a day in cold water; and
he soon became so fond of it that he went into the
bath of his own accord. When he was not with the
queen, he remained in a cold room, wore light silk
clothes, and generally ran about barefooted. He had
only one playmate of his own age, the natural son of
a surgeon, called little Karl. No difference was made
between them; and they helped each other in dressing
and undressing. They climbed about; shouted; broke
whatever they liked; and did what they pleased generally,
care being taken to remove anything with which
they might hurt each other. If the little prince cried
for anything, it was not given him unless he really
wanted it; but he was not consoled or reproved. If
one of the boys fell, he had to get up by himself, and
never thought of making a fuss about it.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Generally,
the lads were allowed to help themselves. If one of
them was hurt, nobody pitied him; and if they quarrelled,
they were allowed to fight it out, while none of
the valets were suffered to speak or play with them.
So strictly was the latter rule kept, that one day, at
the Frederiksberg Palace, the young prince, happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
to fall in the garden and hurt himself, Struensee's
favourite valet picked him up, and ventured to soothe
him. For this, the culprit was sent to the Blue Tower,
a civic prison for disorderly persons.</p>

<p>The two little men frequently contended for the mastery. Once, when
they had fought with greater fury than usual, Frederick asked Karl how he
dared raise his hand against his prince?</p>

<p>"A prince!" the other answered; "I am as much a prince as you."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I am a prince royal," Frederick rejoined, and fell upon his
opponent again, after he had owned himself conquered. The queen, hearing
of this, sent for the lads to her apartment, and insisted on Frederick
begging his playmate's pardon. Frederick refused to submit; and the
queen, provoked by his stubbornness, beat him severely. He was conquered,
but not subdued. By such severity, there is reason to fear that Caroline
Matilda lost her son's affection in his childhood; so much so, that if
he were very unruly, his attendants, as much, perhaps, from malignity as
ignorance, used to threaten to take him to the queen. There is no doubt
that Struensee had advised this strict treatment of the crown prince,
and that his royal mother fully agreed in his views, even though she had
not read "Emile," probably, and was no admirer of the paradoxes of Jean
Jacques.</p>

<p>Still, Struensee found objections raised to the exaggeration of his
treatment of the crown prince by his colleague Berger; and, owing to the
latter, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
prince was allowed to wear shoes and stockings; received warmer clothing;
and had his rice boiled in broth. In the cold season, his room was
slightly warmed in the morning; and he had meat soup twice a week for
dinner.</p>

<p>It seems that the servants, in their indolence, at times greatly
neglected their duties to the young prince. In the autumn of 1770,
while the court were enjoying the chase, the stag ran to the woods of
Frederiksborg and Fredensborg, which were about fifteen miles to the
north of Hirschholm. The hunting party returned home at a late hour; and
when the young prince was looked after, he was found breathless, and
half dead with cold. He was put to bed with a woman, who took him in
her arms, and gradually brought him round. The crown prince's room at
Hirschholm consisted of a ground-floor apartment, forty feet in length.
On the garden side, it was closed in by an iron trellis-work, which gave
Struensee's accusers an opportunity for alleging that he shut the heir to
the throne up in a cage. After the favourite's downfall, a wooden bowl
was shown as a relic, in which it was stated that the food was given to
the crown prince while at Hirschholm.</p>

<p>The best proof of what little real value these charges had, is simply
found in the fact that the future king, Frederick VI., was able to endure
fatigue at a very advanced age which completely knocked up younger men;
he indubitably owed this to the early hardening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of his frame and the frugality of his mode of life when a child. While
his grandfather and great-grandfather only lived to the age of forty odd,
he attained the ordinary range of human life. It is evident, too, that
the prince, long after he had grown his own master, must have considered
his early moderation in eating and drinking as good for him, because he
adhered to it through his youth; and even when he became king, his table
was remarkable for its simplicity. But we shall have an opportunity of
reverting to this subject when excellent Reverdil returns to court next
year.</p>

<p>At the end of October, the court removed to the palace of
Frederiksberg. Here it was arranged that, on every Monday afternoon,
there should be a court at the Christiansborg Palace, in town, and on
every Thursday evening a concert in the park of Frederiksberg. For a
long time, no court had been held; and the king only appeared there for
a few minutes, and addressed nobody. Hence the queen had to receive the
respects of the company alone, and make her observations on the faces of
the ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>The condition of Christian had by this time become hopeless, and
arrangements had to be made to keep the people as much as possible
from a sight of a king of this sort. Adam Oehlenschläger, in his "Life
Recollections," has given us the following characteristic traits of the
king's malady:&mdash;At times it was found difficult to induce him to
perform the royal duty of signing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
but when the word "deposition" was menacingly whispered in his ears, the
poor simpleton became terrified, and signed anything and everything.
Precautions were taken to prevent any violent outbreaks of his mania.
Thus the pages were instructed to hold his chair at table, where he at
times tried to rise and prevent others from eating. It was forbidden
at court to speak to or answer him, in order to prevent any unpleasant
expressions of that absolutism which still nominally existed. At times,
though, remarkable claims were made upon him; thus an impudent page
once drove the king into a corner, and said to him there, "Mad Rex,
make me a groom of the chamber." Another time the king really created a
chamberlain. He had been compelled to sign an appointment as chamberlain
for a man he could not bear. A moment after one of the stove-heaters came
into the room, dressed in his yellow jacket, and with a bundle of wood on
his back.</p>

<p>"Listen, you fellow," said the king; "will you be a chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"H'm! that wouldn't be so bad; but how am I to manage to become
one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing is easier; come with me." And the king took the man, just
as he stood, by the hand, and led him from his cabinet into the hall,
where the whole court was assembled. He walked with his client into the
middle of the assembly, and shouted in a loud voice, "I appoint this man
a chamberlain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>As the fiction that Christian VII. was absolute ruler must be kept up,
they had to acknowledge this appointment, in which the humour of insanity
was expressed; but the title was bought back of the lucky fellow at the
price of a small freehold farm.</p>

<p>The king was generally left to the company of a black boy, introduced
by Brandt, who became Christian's inseparable companion. Children and
fools, it is notorious, have an equal propensity for mischief. Christian
consequently found great delight in smashing the windows and china, with
the black boy's assistance, and beheading the statues in the garden. As
a change, he rolled on the floor with the lad, biting and scratching
him. From time to time, however, there was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'someting'">something</ins> that resembled a
lucid interval. Thus the king one evening suddenly appeared at a court
party, waved his hand to the company, and imperiously ordered "silence."
The whole of the guests stopped and stared, and then the poor gentleman
delivered, with great earnestness and deep pathos, Klopstock's warning
ode "to the princes." This finished, he clapped his hands, burst into a
loud laugh, turned on his heel, and went away.</p>

<p>After reading such an account of the husband to whom Caroline Matilda
was unhappily bound, we can hardly feel surprised that she sought refuge
in dissipation, and for this Struensee amply provided. The Royal Theatre
was enlarged and embellished, and Sarti, the Capellmeister, was ordered
to get up operas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
under the superintendence of Brandt. Further on in the season
performances were also given on Sunday, which caused great annoyance
among the clergy, and justly so; for though Struensee, as a German, was
accustomed to such a desecration of the Sabbath, Caroline Matilda had
been brought up in the Anglican faith, and ought not to have sanctioned
such proceedings by her presence. The only way in which this sudden
change in the queen, which was so utterly at variance with her previous
blameless life, can be accounted for, is, that she was intoxicated by the
homage that now surrounded her, and formed such a contrast with the early
part of her reign.</p>

<p>A regulation about the boxes at the Royal Theatre produced a fresh
grievance among the already disunited family. A separate box was given to
the hereditary Prince Frederick, who had hitherto been accustomed to sit
with the king; because, so the excuse was, the king did not care to have
the prince's suite about him. On this affair a correspondence took place
between the prince's chamberlain and Brandt, but the regulation was not
rescinded. On the other hand, Struensee and Brandt appeared in the royal
box, sometimes seating themselves behind the king and queen. Masquerades
were now also given in the king's theatre, and on the 18th December the
king gave one, to which everybody was admitted. Probably with the object
of extending public liberty, persons in carriages and on foot, without
distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
were allowed to use torches at night. Mobs, doubtless hired for the
purpose, once took advantage of this permission to make a riot, but did
so only once, as the police interfered very sharply. From this time only
few employed the permission granted them.</p>

<p>During the last year the country had suffered from a bad harvest, in
consequence of which the price of bread and flour reached an unheard-of
height. In order to prevent the threatening results of this evil as
far as possible, Struensee issued, early in November, an edict against
exporting corn, while the importation from the duchies, and from one
inland province to another, was encouraged. Many thousand loads of grain
of every description were brought from the provincial granaries to the
capital, and, when a severe winter followed, Struensee sold flour at half
the ordinary price to the inhabitants, caused bread to be sold at the
same rate to the poor, and prohibited the distillation of spirits from
corn.</p>

<p>In this period of universal necessity the court received a visit from
the crown prince of Sweden, the future king, Gustavus III., and his
younger brother, the hereditary prince, Frederick Adolphus. The princes
were present at a masquerade, and in honour of them some of Holberg's
plays were performed, and other court festivals arranged. The elder
prince was not particularly pleased at his reception; having been invited
to dine at the king's table with one or two merchants' wives, he asked if
there were not Jews in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
company too. One of these ladies having scolded him politely for not
paying her a visit, though she was his neighbour, he replied, that he
would severely reprimand the minister of his court, whom he had requested
to present him to all ladies of distinction.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
After a fortnight's stay, the princes continued their journey to Paris,
but paid a visit of some days to their relations at Gottorp. To them
they expressed their dissatisfaction at their reception in Copenhagen;
but though it had been cooler than it should have been between such
close connexions, it was explained by the fact that the Prince of
Sweden neglected his wife most shamefully, and this was well known in
Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The reforms which had been interrupted by this visit, were carried on
with increased zeal after the departure of the royal guests. Struensee
appears to have had great sympathy with suffering humanity, as a decree
of December 7, 1770, proves. In it the establishment of a hospice for 600
poor children of both sexes was ordered, and to cover the expense a tax
was laid on all carriage and saddle horses in the capital.</p>

<p>The next steps that Struensee took appear to me to have been of a
very serious nature, and to have resulted from his erroneous views about
population. It is quite true that secret births, infanticide, and the
exposure of infants, were common in Copenhagen. In order to prevent these
unnatural crimes, Struensee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
ordered a drawer containing a mattress to be placed at a window of the
Lying-in Hospital looking on the street, in which unfortunate mothers
could lay their children to be taken care of by the state. After this
had been carried into effect, twenty-four children were placed in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">crèche</i> during the first four days. Aiding foundlings is a duty which
government cannot neglect without violating the laws of humanity, but
detecting and punishing parents who desert their children is no less
obligatory. The clergy were therefore in the right when they denounced
the new state of things, and stated that it favoured debauchery and
indolence, degraded marriage, and enfeebled the advantages and rights
that ought to encourage it: that it was rearing, at the cost of the
industrious classes, a race of wretches, who would only increase the
duties of the police and the expenses of the state. But Struensee was
of the same opinion as Frederick the Great, who only saw in the human
species a mode of producing soldiers: taking the increase or diminution
of the population as a positive index of a state of prosperity or
decay, Struensee&mdash;instead of merely favouring it indirectly,
by causing good order and diminishing the impediments that checked
the industry of private persons, and prevented them from attaining a
competency&mdash;persuaded himself that the increased multiplication
of children was the most efficacious method of augmenting the public
prosperity; or, in other words, he confounded the effect with the cause.
Hence it is a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
circumstance that the Foundling Hospital was almost the only one of
Struensee's institutions that survived his fall.</p>

<p>Foreign affairs had during the last year attracted general attention.
The insulting pretensions of the Court of Petersburg had been broken by
Bernstorff's dismissal. Up to this time, Filosofow only required to utter
the threat, "Well, the treaty for the exchange of territory will not be
ratified," in order to obtain what he required. Now, the arrangement by
which the foreign envoys had to apply in writing to the king, cut off
all opportunity for personally approaching the king, and we have seen
how angry Filosofow was at the change. At the same time as he sent off
his courier to Petersburg, however, the Danish government despatched
Aide-de-Camp von Warnstedt with a letter from the king to the empress,
notifying the dismissal of Bernstorff, and containing the assurance that
the change would in no way affect the friendly relations between the two
courts.</p>

<p>Struensee, who drew up the letter, was so ignorant of usages, or
neglected to follow them to such an extent, that he simply began "Madam,"
instead of "Madam, my sister," and ended in the ordinary style, "I have
the honour to be, Madam, your Imperial Majesty's very humble and obedient
servant." The real writer of the letter could not refrain, either, from
displaying in it the superiority of his views, for he mixed up in it some
salutary lessons on politics. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
was the apparent message; but Warnstedt was secretly entrusted with
letters for the Orlows, who were the enemies of Panin, the Russian
minister, and friends of Filosofow and Saldern. He talked foolishly about
the latter commission, so that it reached the ears of Mestmacher, the
Russian chargé d'affaires at Copenhagen, and the Petersburg court knew
before Warnstedt arrived of what letters he was the bearer.</p>

<p>When the envoy arrived at St. Petersburg, he learned that the empress
was so unfavourably disposed toward Denmark, that for some time past she
had not invited the Danish ambassador, Count Scheel, and his wife to
her evening circle. The envoy extraordinary could only obtain a public
audience from the empress, who received the letter from his hands, and
conversed graciously with him, but no answer was given him. As for
the private letters, very good care was taken that they should not be
delivered. When Warnstedt returned to Copenhagen he was put under arrest,
as a satisfaction for the Russian minister, though it was publicly stated
that he had spoken incautiously about Christian VII. while in Petersburg.
He was, however, liberated soon after.</p>

<p>This treatment of Warnstedt led to the belief in Copenhagen that the
government was angry at the answer received from Petersburg; and Count
Rantzau, the old foe of the Petersburg cabinet, began publicly rejoicing
that the Russian yoke which Denmark had borne too long, was now shaken
off. But Struensee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
behaved in the affair with statesmanlike demeanour and caution, so that
Filosofow quite lost his head, and even displayed traces of insanity. He
requested his recall, and it was granted. Before he left, he desired a
private audience from Christian, and was told that he could only see the
king in the apartment, and could take leave there. He replied that his
health did not allow him to be present, and he went away without taking
leave of a single member of the royal family.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The Foreign Office was next given to Count <span class="smcap">von
der Osten</span>, who had been Danish envoy at Naples. As he plays an
important part in the narrative, I will say a few words here about his
birth and chequered fortunes.</p>

<p>Being without a patrimony, he was educated at court as page in the
house of Frederick V. As he evidenced talent and cunning, Count von
Moltke granted him a pension to study abroad. During his first journey
to Leipzig, he made the acquaintance of Count Stanislaus Poniatowski,
afterwards King of Poland, and they even slept in the same bed. On
returning home, the first use Osten made of his talents was to induce
the page of the chamber to deliver to the king a memorial against Count
von Moltke and his administration, and against Bernstorff, who had the
confidence of the king and his favourite. The king, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
dismissing his favourite and his minister, showed them the libel, and
as they soon saw that the person who handed it in was not capable of
composing it, they urged him to reveal the real author. Moderate and
honourable as they were, they took no further vengeance than sending
their young adversary to take some lessons in politics, and for this
purpose entrusted him to Malzahn, at that time minister in Russia.</p>

<p>Although Von der Osten was not given an official post, he contrived
to seize on one. Malzahn died, and the secretary to the embassy being
ill, Osten took upon himself to seal up the archives, receive despatches,
and confer with the Russian ministers. Bernstorff confirmed him in
the appointment he had seized, and sent him his instructions, which
were, among other things, that he must humour the grand duchess, whose
elevation the Copenhagen cabinet already foresaw. Von der Osten paid his
court to her, by telling her all he could learn about foreign politics.
This young princess was silently preparing to play a part, though I
cannot affirm whether she flattered herself with the hope of managing her
husband, or that she thought even then of getting rid of him.</p>

<p>As the grand duchess had no children, the Empress Elizabeth declared
to her some time after that there must absolutely be a successor to the
empire, and pointed out to her the man who might cure her sterility. This
proposal at first revolted Catharine, and she rejected it as an insult.
But when it was added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
that such respectable scruples might cause her to be sent away, her
hesitation ceased, and after awhile there was no necessity to force
lovers upon her. While Von der Osten was envoy at Petersburg, he received
a visit from the young Poniatowski, whom he had known at Leipzig.
Poniatowski was at first only a simple companion and intimate friend of
Hanbury Williams, the English envoy; but during a lengthened residence at
Petersburg he was entrusted with a commission by Augustus III. of Poland.
He was handsome, well-informed, eloquent&mdash;in a word, made to please;
and the grand duchess accepted his homage. Von der Osten was their
confidant, and either acting in conformity with the intentions of his
court, or through friendship for Poniatowski, he did not refuse them his
good offices, but offered to cover the <em>liaison</em>, by lending his hotel as
their rendezvous. Poniatowski came there <em>incognito</em>, and the princess,
disguised as a man, escaped from her palace, and got into a hired
carriage, in which the Secretary von der Osten received and accompanied
her.</p>

<p>An intrigue, or some other cause, removed Von der Osten from
Petersburg, but he was employed at Dresden in 1762. When the revolution
rendered the empress independent, and removed the necessity for mystery,
she begged the King of Denmark to send Von der Osten back to her court.
For two years she not only granted him greater access and favours than a
foreign minister could claim, but consulted him on the affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of the empire, and admitted him to the conferences held in her presence
between her ministers and her general officers. He fell from this
elevation most suddenly; the Russian minister informed all the foreign
envoys, by a circular note, that the empress had withdrawn her favour
from Herr von der Osten, and regarded him as a vile and odious person.
He remained some time at Petersburg, going to court, where nobody spoke
to him, and not seeking to justify himself. Business no longer passed
through his hands: the secretary to the embassy received the despatches
from his court, and answered them without Osten's participation.</p>

<p>This took place in 1764, or about the period of the Polish throne
being vacant. Von der Osten had received orders to make common cause with
the dissidents, who desired the election of Stanislaus; but he was of a
different opinion, and worked against his old friend in favour of a Count
Oginsky, who was younger and handsomer, and whom he tried to please by
dyeing his red eyebrows black. This attachment so blinded him, that, in
the ante-chamber of the empress, and at the time when he was in favour,
he offered to bet on the election of Oginsky against that of Stanislaus.
Oginsky paid him for such warm protection, and I have no doubt gave but
slight attention to the colour of his eyebrows. The publicity which the
Russian court gave to Osten's disgrace refers to some secret infamy, and
not to the two Polish rivals. It is supposed that, having succeeded in
attaining a position by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the help of Madame Bestucheff, who was a Dane, he eventually committed
some signal act of treachery against her husband. It must have been
during the period of his favour at Petersburg that Osten obtained the
title of Count, for he was not so by birth. At the same period he asked
for the order of the Dannebrog, but Bernstorff answered him that he
had been a page too recently; and for this refusal Von der Osten never
forgave the Danish minister.</p>

<p>After so many causes of bitterness, old and new, Bernstorff, not
wishing to avenge himself by disgracing Osten, or recall to court an
enemy whose talent for intrigue had become notorious, sent the count
to Naples. After awhile, as the count did not cease to complain of
an employment which he regarded as an exile, the minister had the
complaisance to nominate him for Paris <em>vice</em> Von Gleichen; but at the
first hint the French court received of this, it ordered the Marquis de
Blosset to protest at Copenhagen against this choice. Then Bernstorff
destined him for the Hague; but, his own power ceasing shortly after, he
saw himself succeeded by the man whose friendship he had only been able
to gain by such indulgence and kindness.</p>

<p>Von der Osten's conduct in his new post was not deficient in skill
or dignity, but Struensee's hope of moving the Russian court by this
appointment failed. The new minister's first measure on taking office was
one in which his character could be plainly read. He wished to flatter
the Russian court, and yet not displease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the party that ruled at his own. He sent to the former a species of
apology about the great changes that had taken place at his court, and
displayed considerable eloquence in it. This document met with a better
fate at Petersburg than the king's letter, and many people applauded it.
It may be assumed that the Russian court, whose pride had been terribly
hurt by the loss of its influence in Danish affairs, was glad to avenge
itself on the King of Denmark by this little humiliation, and to be able
to withdraw from the whole affair with an appearance of honour; at any
rate, the empress adhered to her decision, and declared openly that so
long as foreign affairs were in the hands of Von der Osten, the alliance
and negotiations with Denmark would be broken off.</p>

<p>After the rescript about the new organization of the privy council
had been issued, Privy Councillor Schack, Lieutenant General Gähler,
Vice Admiral Römeling, and Count Rantzau-Ascheberg, were formed into
a committee to make a further proposition about it. By this rescript
the power of the council had been considerably restricted, and further
limitations appeared to be impending. Schack opposed this reform, and
when he found it was of no use, he retired without a pension to his
estate in Jütland. As we stated, the discussions and proposals of the
privy council were to be sent in writing to the king, and when Struensee
was appointed Maître des Requêtes, on December 18, 1770, it was his duty
to read to the king the reports of the privy council. But a very few days
later, the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
received a death-blow through the following decree written and signed by
the king:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p>We, Christian VII., by grace of God King of Denmark, Norway, of
the Goths and Wends, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Stormarn and the
Dittmarsches, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, &amp;c., decree and
announce herewith. As the affairs of state in an absolute government
are only confused and delayed when many persons of high rank take part
in them, owing to the respect which the latter acquire with the course
of time, and the settlement of business is thus retarded: we, however,
who have nothing so much at heart as a zealous promotion of the public
welfare, will not let ourselves be checked or hindered in those measures
and arrangements that tend to this object: we have therefore thought
proper to abolish and absolutely suppress our former privy council;
in doing which, our object is to restore to the constitution of the
state all its purity and to maintain it. Thus, then, the said form of
government will be and remain exactly as it was handed to our ancestors
of glorious memory by the nation, and not the slightest appearance will
be left, as if we wished to depart from the sense and intention with
which the nation transmitted it to our ancestors. In further confirmation
of the above, we have had the present decree drawn up in duplicate, in
Danish and German, and the articles shall be preserved for ever in the
archives of the Chanceries. Given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
under our royal hand and seal, at our castle of Frederiksberg, this 27th
December, 1770.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smallcp">Christian.</span><br />
FABRICIUS. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">A. G. CARSTENS</span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This singular edict was generally attributed to
Rantzau, but the avowed motive lay as much in the
king's character as in Struensee's: neither of them
liked people of consequence, but how could they suppose
that they had disarmed the nobility, by discharging
those who had acquired credit and consideration?
After all, it is power that rules, and this power
must be in the hands of somebody. Frederick the
Great found a way of diminishing the power of his
ministers, by being his own minister, and this was
what was intended at Copenhagen. But what resemblance
was there between the two kings? Struensee,
by making himself the inspirer, could not hope to remain
long concealed; in fact, everybody saw his
movements already. The king, who eagerly took up
the idea of imitating his brother of Prussia, ere long had
a stereotyped answer for everything: "Apply to Struensee."
Hence, there was a Grand Vizier, and surely the
nation did not gain much by suppressing four ministers
assembled in council, and giving the power to one man.</p>

<p>This decree appeared to be greeted with applause
by all save the old nobles, for the heavy taxes which
weighed down the country, were placed to the account
of the privy council, and people were offended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
arrogance with which several members looked down
on other persons, while they did not hesitate to render
themselves the tools of licentious favourites. With
the suspension of the council, the members were dismissed
from their other offices as well. Rosenkrantz
alone received a pension, which he owed to the intercession
of his friend Frau von Gähler,&mdash;a proof of the
still existing influence of certain ladies of the court on
public affairs, although it had been announced that
firm principles would be followed in everything.
Rosenkrantz was also 14,000 dollars in debt to the
Treasury. After their dismissal, the four ministers
quitted the capital and retired to their estates.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>On the day after the suppression of the privy council,
a privy council of conferences was established.
The idea of this council seems to have been derived
from what took place in Russia during the reign of
the Empress Anne, but it never attained any importance.
The members met whenever requested to do
so by the king, and then expressed their opinion about
matters laid before them.</p>

<p>The power was now once more collected in the sole
person of the king, as had been the case with the first
absolute monarch of Denmark and Norway, in 1660.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
His advisers in public business were, on the one hand,
a man of bourgeois birth, who had not been trained as a
statesman, but had risen rapidly; on the other, men, who
liked reforms, and hence were regarded with hateful
glances by all those whose interests they attacked. The
results, however, attained by these advisers displayed
some amount of talent. It seemed as if fresh life and
order were being re-introduced into the state, if we can
admit that such things ever before existed. A very
wide field was also opened for ideas by the free Press.
Still, months passed ere people ventured to employ it
in discussing affairs of state. Numerous pamphlets
appeared, but were of slight value. Gradually, however,
learned men took up the pen, in order to take
advantage of the liberty granted them, and publicly
discussed important state matters, such as serfdom,
corvées, the system of guilds, monopolies, the bank,
the army, the university, Norway, Zeeland, &amp;c. Most
of these <em>litterateurs</em> were anonymous, but among them
were men of scientific reputation, such as Jacob Baden,
Fleischer, Schumacher, &amp;c. The majority of these
essays clearly proved, however, how few sound and
correct views about government had gained admission
into Denmark at that period. That the press should
also produce a countless number of pasquinades and
abusive pamphlets, was only what was expected, and
the good sale of such things, although their price was
raised, at any rate furnished proof of a desire to read
being aroused among the people, which in the end led
to the perusal of better literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>But the general joy at the liberty of the press and
other excellent regulations was greatly damaged by
the fact that all the cabinet orders appeared in German.
It is true that the court had been, for centuries,
the centre of Germanism in Denmark, and this fact, even
in the reign of Christian VI., had caused a German to
remark to that king, who was a Dane all over, "It is
strange that your Majesty should be the only foreigner
in your own house;" and under the seventh Christian,
it was also the fact that the higher classes could neither
speak nor write Danish; while there were high officials,
who, in spite of a lengthened residence in Copenhagen,
could not speak Danish. The army was drilled and
commanded after the German regulations; and the
courts-martial were minuted in German. As, however,
the public were aware that the present king
spoke and wrote Danish well, and as it had not
hitherto been customary to publish any decrees or
government regulations, save those intended for the
duchies, in German, an insult to the Danish nation
was seen in Struensee's German decrees, as he addressed
them in a foreign language. Hence it was
natural that this mistake produced Struensee many
enemies, who, solely on that account, became his political
opponents. Struensee apologized for his error
by saying that he had no time to learn Danish; but
surely there was nothing to prevent him from having
his cabinet orders translated into Danish.</p>

<p>A curious instance of a mistake occasioned by Struensee's
use and abuse of German is preserved for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
by Reverdil. An individual in Norway, whose house
stood on a very rapid river, down which wood was
floated to the sea, had put up in front of his house a
stockade to stop the wood, and agreed with the woodmen
as to the price they should pay for the use of his
establishment. The persons interested, desiring to
render their contract more solemn, requested the king
to ratify it, according to a received custom. This request
was sent from the Danish Chancery to the cabinet
with a favourable report. The clerk who had to translate
the documents into German did not understand the
word <em>flaxboom</em>, by which the stockade was designated;
and as he saw that the affair related to the right of
passage on the river, and as <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">flachs</i> meant flax in German,
he assumed that these persons were arranging a
tax to be paid on all flax brought down the river.
This offended Struensee, who at once addressed a reprimand
to the Chancery, on its proposition to establish
a toll which would be very onerous upon the flax trade,
and contrary to all the principles of political economy.
The Chancery replied, that his Majesty had doubtless
been deceived by his German translator; that no flax
came down the river; and, in a word, cleared up the
misunderstanding. The explanation gained the department
a fresh reprimand, for having the audacity
to suppose that his Majesty had Danish reports translated,
and did not understand his own language.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1771, the court quitted the palace
of Frederiksberg,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and returned to the Christiansborg
Palace.</p>

<p>Christiansborg, built by Christian VI., was an enormous
edifice. It consisted of six stories above the
vaults,&mdash;three of these were extremely large and lofty,
and dedicated to state purposes; three other stories
ran between, not more than eight feet high, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Mezzanines, where the state ministers and royal attendants
had suites of rooms. The queen's apartments
were in the grand or east front, on the second great
story; the king's were on the same floor, further to the
south; the royal chapel formed another division of this
vast palace; a lower structure, or wing, under which
was one of the entrances to this huge edifice, formed
a continuation of the Mezzanine story. Struensee's
apartments were in the Mezzanine, opening into the
grand passage leading to the royal chapel, and next to
the queen's apartments; Count Brandt's rooms were
on the same story, adjoining Struensee's, but next
the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The queen dowager and Prince Frederick
occupied the whole of the third floor when
they were residing in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The first measure taken by Struensee in this year
was the appointment of Professor Oeder, who had
hitherto been a member of the agricultural commission,
as Councillor of Finances and member of the
Financial Deputation. This was a title hitherto unknown
in Denmark; but Oeder justified the choice,
although he had been hitherto better known as a
botanist and author of a "<cite>Flora Danica</cite>." He took
a considerable share in Struensee's cabinet labours,
and expressed his opinion about state affairs and reforms
openly when invited to do so. He often opposed
Struensee's views; still more often warned him
against precipitate and violent measures; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
favourite was more disposed to listen to Order than
to many others.</p>

<p>On January 12, the Prussian bank director, Koes,
received permission to establish a royal Danish lottery
for a term of six years. For the privilege, an annual
sum of 25,000 dollars was to be paid into the king's
private exchequer. The farmer and his partners published
a plan of subscription, containing two hundred
and fifty shares of 500 dollars each; and ten per cent.
profit was guaranteed the shareholders. The directors
of the lottery appointed two thousand collectors
all over the country; and a drawing took place every
three weeks.</p>

<p>The introduction of the lottery justly aroused great
public reproach. For all that, the following Danish
governments found this institution so profitable, that
they undertook the direction of it, and it was not until
public opinion began to become very decided about
this corruption offered to the poorer classes, that it
was entirely abolished in the reign of Christian VIII.
Struensee only authorised the establishment of the
lottery, it is urged, because at that time the country
swarmed with pedlars, who sold tickets of foreign
lotteries, by which a great deal of money was drawn
out of the country, and he tried to prevent this by
starting a home lottery for gamblers. A number of
pamphlets at once appeared in Copenhagen and other
towns of the kingdom, in which the ruinous results of
lottery gambling were shown, though without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
effect. When the lottery was established at Copenhagen
and Wandsbeck, the people were attacked by a perfect
mania for gambling, and while formerly the conversation
in the houses of citizens turned on the weather
and town scandal, they now talked about the best way
of playing, about ambos, ternes, and quaterns, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The king's birthday, January 29, was employed by
the new government as a favourable opportunity for
gaining the favour of the populace. For this purpose,
an antique fountain was erected in the manège behind
the Christiansborg Palace, from which red and white
wine flowed. Everybody was allowed to fetch it away,
except the sailors of the navy. From the balcony
over the fountain a herald threw gold and silver
medals among the crowd, bearing on the obverse the
king's bust, and on the reverse the date, "January
29, 1771," with the king's motto, "Gloria ex amore
patriæ." At the same time, a roast ox and sundry
roast sheep were cut up and distributed. It seems as
if the intention were to throw some lustre upon the
throne, which would compensate for the <em>nimbus</em> with
which the now removed high-born ministers and great
gentlemen had formerly invested it in the eyes of the
populace.</p>

<p>The king's birthday was, however, glorified in another
manner. The reigning queen established on this
day a new order, called the Order of Matilda. The
statutes, which were drawn up in French, were to the
following effect:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>Art. I.&mdash;The order shall be called the Order of
Matilda.</p>

<p>Art. II.&mdash;It shall be conferred on both ladies and
gentlemen; but the number must never exceed twenty-four,
the queen, its founder, included.</p>

<p>Art. III.&mdash;It shall only be conferred on persons who
have deserved the particular attention of the queen,
independently of merit or services rendered.</p>

<p>Art. IV.&mdash;It is forbidden to ask for the order; and
those ladies and gentlemen who act contrary to this
rule, will deprive themselves for ever of the hope of
obtaining it.</p>

<p>Art. V.&mdash;Those ladies or gentlemen who, on receiving
the Order of Matilda, may possess that of the
Perfect Union of the late queen, Sophia Magdalena,
shall deliver the insignia of the latter to the queen.</p>

<p>Art. VI.&mdash;The order shall be worn with a pink
ribbon, striped with silver. The gentlemen shall wear
it round the neck, and the ladies fasten it in the shape
of a bow on the left breast.</p>

<p>Art. VII.&mdash;On the death of any lady or gentleman
decorated with it, the heirs are expected to send the
insignia of the order to the queen.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The badge itself consisted of a round medallion,
with the letters C. M. set in costly diamonds, the royal
crown over it, and a laurel wreath round. The king
and queen, the queen dowager, and the hereditary
Prince Frederick, were the first royal personages who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
assumed the new order. The others to whom it was
given on the day of its institution, were Count Rantzau-Ascheberg,
Privy Councillor von der Osten, Lieut.-General
von Gähler, Chamberlain Enevold Brandt,
Struensee, Baroness von Schimmelmann, Frau von
Gähler, and the Countess Holstein zu Holsteinborg.
The evident object was to indicate the queen's adherents
by this distinction, but Struensee's enemies asserted
that he had despised the Dannebrog, but did not
yet dare demand the Elephant, and hence the new order
was instituted. There was nothing remarkable, however,
in Caroline Matilda founding an order, as well as
other queens before her.</p>

<p>The new rulers, however, did not at all forget,
through the festivities on the royal birthday, to extend
to the court the proposed system of retrenchment in
the expenses of the state. It was seen to be absolutely
necessary that the expenditure of the court should undergo
strict revision. Struensee and Brandt tried together
to induce Councillor of Legation Texier, who
had accompanied the king on his tour as treasurer, to
undertake the duties of a court intendant. But this
clear-sighted man declined the offer most politely, and
Struensee had to look elsewhere for assistance.</p>

<p>It was quite useless to expect any good from Count
Moltke, the court marshal and son of Frederick V.'s
favourite, for he was preternaturally stupid. Abuses
and foolish expenses had been multiplied under his
rule, and there were the most valid reasons for getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
rid of him; but, on the other hand, he had one of the
prettiest and least strict wives at court. Struensee had
a weakness for her, and considered her necessary for the
new tone he wished to give the court. He therefore
resolved on a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">mezzo termine</i>, and sent for a Lieutenant-Colonel
von Wegener, who had taught the princes
of Hesse mathematics, and was at present at the head
of Prince Charles's household, into which he had introduced
great regularity. Struensee gave him the title
of Intendant of the Court, with charge of the expenses,
while Count von Moltke would retain the introductions,
the ceremonial, and do what is called the honours. On
the king informing Moltke of all the details of which
he relieved him, while leaving him his salary, the latter
became very violent, demanded his dismissal, obtained
it, insisted on his wife accompanying him to his paternal
estate, and died on arriving there. A rumour was
spread that his wife had poisoned him; but she justified
herself by having an autopsy performed, accompanied
by a regular report from the physicians. This
fact struck people greatly, and the patriotic party concluded
that morals were hopelessly ruined, as such
atrocious suspicions could be conceived.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after, however, two dismissals took place at
court, which were not at all connected with the economical
system. Page of the Chamber Von Köppern
was so impudent as to speak disrespectfully about
Struensee to the king, and thus caused his own fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Chamberlain von Warnstedt, too, who had hitherto
been a favourite of the king, and stood in confidential
relations with Struensee, was suddenly dismissed from
court. A single incautious remark about Struensee
proved his ruin. On his birthday, in February, Warnstedt
received a letter from the king, in which the
monarch intimated that being aware of Warnstedt's inclination
for a military life, he discharged him from
court with a pension of 800 dollars, and had nominated
him second-lieutenant in the Schleswig dragoons, with
orders to join his regiment without delay.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>But dismissals were the order of the day, not only
at court but among the government officials. This
fate first befell the two oldest directors of the General
Staat, Conferenzrath von Schrödersee and Etats-rath
Holm, who were both discharged without pension.
They were followed by the bailiff and under-bailiff of
Copenhagen: the former because he was alleged to behave
too severely, the latter too mildly, to the peasants.
The dismissal of these two officials was ascribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
to General von Gähler, but unjustly so. Struensee
was accustomed to confer with the general frequently,
who had many enemies. The sudden dismissals were
not confined to the capital and its immediate vicinity,
but extended to all parts of the monarchy. The most
important of them was the removal of Privy Councillor
von Benzon, viceroy of the kingdom of Norway. This
universally respected old gentleman was dismissed on
February 8; the post of an <em>alter ego</em> of the king in the
second kingdom was not filled up for the present, and
the management of the business, which had hitherto
been transacted by the viceroy, was left to the bailiffs.
After the viceroy, the next victim was Bürgermeister
von Wasmer of Bergen, who was discharged for disobedience
and insubordination. As, afterwards, many
shared the same fate without the causes for their dismissal
being imparted to them, it was natural that the
most honest and valued officials no longer felt secure.
On the other hand, it is indubitable that from this
time the business of the state was carried on with
greater attention and industry than before.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>A decree that aroused general satisfaction appeared
on February 12. It consisted of a circular to the government
colleges, in which they were informed that
in future no lackey who had waited on a master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
must be proposed for a public office. In this way the hateful lackeydom
was abolished, and a permanent obstacle raised against the repeated
neglect of scientifically-educated men, on behalf of fellows who had
driven a carriage or stood behind it.</p>

<p>The administration of the navy was not forgotten among the reforms.
Privy Councillor Count Haxthausen was ordered to confer with Etats-rath
Willebrandt, and draw up a new organization for the Admiralty College.</p>

<p>About this time a friend of Struensee made his appearance at
Copenhagen, whose cruel fate, after the catastrophe of 1772, will for
ever remain a blot on Danish justice. <span class="smcap">Seneca Otho
von Falckenskjold</span> was descended from an old noble Danish family,
and was born, in 1738, at Slagelse, on Seeland. Intended by his father,
who held high rank in the army, for a military career, he entered the
service in his thirteenth year. On leaving the cadet school four years
later, when the Seven Years' War broke out, Falckenskjold, instead of
intriguing at Copenhagen with women and valets, entered the service of
France, served in Alsace, was slightly wounded at Bergen, but so severely
at Clostercamp, where Maréchal de Castries defeated the Hanoverians, that
he was rendered incapable of serving for some time. When his country was
threatened with a Russian war in 1762, Falckenskjold returned home, and
received a company in the Delmenhorst regiment, and afterwards a command
in Norway. When his corps was disbanded, Falckenskjold resided for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
time at Altona, where Rantzau inspired him with a taste for politics.
Shortly after, being animated with a lively desire for information, he
travelled through Sweden, Germany, France, and England, in order to
become acquainted with the institutions of those countries and learn
their language. On his return to Copenhagen he was appointed aide-de-camp
and chamberlain to the king. When, in 1768, the war broke out between
Russia and the Porte, he entered the Russian service, was appointed
lieutenant-colonel in the engineers, served, in 1769, under Prince
Galitzin, and was present at the capture of Khotzim. In the following
year, being employed with the army of which Count Romanzow took the
command, he distinguished himself at the battle of Larga, received
the cross of St. George for being the first man to enter the Turkish
entrenched camp, and was one of the first twelve knights of this order,
which had been recently founded. He also distinguished himself at the
battle of Kahul, and was appointed a full colonel, with the commission
and rank of a brigadier.</p>

<p>This was a man whom Struensee could employ, and therefore he recalled
him, in order to entrust to him the reform of the Danish army, and
employ him in the negotiations with Russia for the pestilent exchange
of territory. Falckenskjold was reluctant to quit the Russian service,
where he had the best prospects of speedy promotion; but he yielded to
Struensee's wishes, as a speedy return to the Russian service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
was promised him, but chiefly that he might offer his assistance in the
diplomatic negociations between the two kingdoms.</p>

<p>On arriving in Copenhagen, Falckenskjold was nominated proprietor and
colonel of the regiment of Foot Guards, and attached to the commission
appointed to renew the suspended negociations with Russia, about which
Struensee was extremely anxious. As Falckenskjold was thoroughly
acquainted with Russian affairs, he was sent to Petersburg with the
embassy intended to press for the fulfilment of the treaty signed in
1768, and, disappointed in his expectations, returned at the period
when the menacing storm was rapidly gathering over Struensee. Brandt
insisted on his being appointed marshal of the court, but Falckenskjold
could not be persuaded to accept the office, and contented himself
with being the confidential adviser of Struensee, and in that capacity
repeatedly warned him to take his measures against any sudden change of
fortune&mdash;advice which, unfortunately, was not listened to by the
dazzled favourite, who was constantly engaged with fresh schemes.</p>

<p>At the time when Falckenskjold reached Copenhagen, Rantzau's faction
were urging an open war with Russia, in consequence of the non-fulfilment
of the treaty; and even Struensee did not consider such a war desperate.
But Falckenskjold was violently opposed to it, and when Struensee
declared that the bomb-ketches built to attack Algiers could be employed
to batter Cronstadt, and that the king would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
not hesitate to sacrifice all his plate to defray the expenses of such
an expedition, the old soldier brought forward some pregnant facts.
He reminded Struensee that a resource of this nature, employed by
Louis XIV. daring the war of the Succession, only produced 450,000
livres. He then entered into a detail about the expense of a single
campaign against Russia, and compared it with the present resources of
Denmark, the condition of her armaments, and the assistance she might
expect from foreign powers. Besides, supposing that the king, though
he (Falckenskjold) was far from admitting the fact, was strong enough
to attack such an enemy with a hope of success, the maritime powers,
especially England, would not suffer their relations to be interrupted in
the Baltic, or allow ports advantageous to their trade, and from which
they derived a great portion of their naval equipment, to be destroyed.
Falckenskjold also urged that, there was reason to apprehend that the
King of Prussia would interfere in the quarrel to the prejudice of
Denmark, in order to carry out his designs upon Holland.</p>

<p>These considerations produced an effect on Struensee, but Rantzau and
his partisans did everything to efface the impression they had produced.
The threatening tone which they openly assumed in talking about Russia,
and which they rendered the fashion in Copenhagen, was carried to so
insulting a point, that the Russian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i> repeatedly told
Falckenskjold that he would have left long before were it not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the hopes that he (Falckenskjold) gave him. This indiscreet bravado on
the part of the Rantzau faction greatly displeased Struensee, however,
and gave weight to Falckenskjold's remonstrances.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Struensee's reforms went on uninterruptedly; and
various ameliorations in the law courts appeared one after the other.
Thus a regulation was issued relating to the corvées on the noble
estates, by which the poor serf ceased to be a helpless tool in the hands
of his owner. Certain days and hours in the week were set apart for
compulsory service, but the remaining time was left at the disposal of
the peasantry. The latter were placed under the protection of the law,
and all the privileges which belonged to them as men and citizens, were
secured to them.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the delay in judicial investigations through
chicanery or neglect, a list was ordered of all persons under arrest for
criminal offences, with a statement of their crimes, the time they had
been detained, and the names of their judges. The names also of those
judges were reported who had proved negligent in the performance of their
duties.</p>

<p>In order that trustees might not carry on usury with the property
of their wards, or squander it, but that heirs and creditors might
receive their funds in due course, a list was ordered to be sent to the
government of all the estates of deceased persons and bankrupts, the
names of the trustees and assignees, and the period when the latter were
appointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>The two chanceries were subjected to a reorganization,
the almost sovereign heads of these colleges dismissed, and in their
stead the Danish Chancery had four, the German three, deputies, and the
same number of departments.</p>

<p>The civic government of Copenhagen also underwent reorganization.
The complaints raised on all sides about the misuse of authority, the
slow course of business, and the maladministration of the town revenues
and neglect in providing the city with provisions, were the ostensible
reasons for these reforms. The magistracy would, in future, consist of
a chief president, two bürgermeisters, a town syndic, a town physician,
four councillors, and two representatives. But even in this simple matter
court intrigues prevailed,&mdash;Count Holstein zu Holsteinborg was
appointed president; one of those men with whom a great name and a little
charlatanism hold the place of merit. He had been recalled from Tondern,
where he was bailiff, because his wife was considered worthy of adorning
the new court, and Brandt distinguished her.</p>

<p>This change, however, was not effected without considerable
dissatisfaction, for it was an encroachment on the privileges which the
city had obtained at various times from the kings, and especially for its
glorious defence against the Swedes in 1759. Still it was a notorious
fact that the magistracy misapplied their power, and did not trouble
themselves at all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the proposals of the council of thirty-two notables, and hence the new
regulations found as many approvers as opponents.</p>

<p>The police of Copenhagen were next subjected to a different
organization. They were most severely prohibited from interfering any
more in the domestic affairs of the inhabitants, or troubling themselves
about what did and did not take place in private houses on Sundays, so
that the citizens of Copenhagen could henceforth say with the Englishman:
"My house is my castle."</p>

<p>In order to check the usual expense of funerals, which were frequently
carried on so extravagantly that the survivors were ruined, an order
was issued to the effect that, in future, all burials should take
place between one and six o'clock in the morning; but this period was
afterwards extended to nine o'clock. In Struensee's time there were
streets in Copenhagen without a name: the houses were not numbered,
and the lighting of the streets was in a wretched state. Orders were
therefore given to alter this at once, and light all the streets daily
with reverbère lamps from dusk till daylight.</p>

<p>The repulsive custom by which persons condemned of adultery were
exposed in the pillory and reprimanded by the clergyman of their parish
in the presence of the whole congregation, was prohibited; and it was
ordered by a royal decree that illegitimate birth should no longer be
regarded as dishonouring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Such a child would be christened precisely in the same way, and within
the same period, as legitimate children; its birth would no longer be
regarded as a lasting stain, or prevent it from learning a trade, or
carrying on business. At the same time, the domestic peace was protected
against calumny and denunciation by an order that no one but the offended
party should make a complaint about adultery.</p>

<p>The countless number of various law courts which existed in Copenhagen
and the rest of the country prior to Struensee's time,&mdash;such as the
Aulic Council, the Lower Court, the Upper Court, the Admiralty Court, the
Police Court, the Commercial Court, the Hospital Court, the Magistracy,
the Commercial College, the Consistory, &amp;c.,&mdash;were all abolished
on April 15, and, in their stead, a single jurisdiction,&mdash;"the Court
and Town Council of Copenhagen,"&mdash;was instituted. Land-surveyor
Wessel, brother of the celebrated satirical poet Peter Wessel, of whom
the latter wrote, "He surveys the land, and learns the laws, and is as
industrious as I may be called indolent," was appointed assessor of the
new court. This step was greatly abused by the lawyers; but the result
soon proved that Struensee had made a good choice, for within six weeks
after the establishment of the new court Wessel had got it into perfect
working order.</p>

<p>Various changes and reductions now took place at court. The vacant
post of a Chief Master of the Ceremonies was not filled up. In the queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
household, two ladies-in-waiting were dismissed,&mdash;Baroness von Wedel
and Fräulein von Eyben, the latter with a post in the noble convent
of St. John, at Schleswig, and a pension of 300 dollars. The numerous
supernumerary officers were dismissed; but, on the other hand, the staff
of valets was increased. In order that the pages might no longer be
admitted to that domestic and servile familiarity in the palace, which
only taught them intrigues and crooked paths to promotion, Struensee
discharged them all; and, in their place, three land and three sea
cadets, under the inspection of an officer, were ordered to wait on their
Majesties. These young men were only to remain at court for a year, and
then others would take their place. The pensions and salaries at court
were nearly all reduced, including that of Court-painter Als, who lost
nearly one-half of his 800 dollars a year. The number of horses kept
in the royal stud and stables was also reduced to one hundred, while
the sale of the superfluous cattle produced the sum of 30,000 dollars.
For the sake of economy, the embellishment and enlargement of the royal
palaces were also stopped.</p>

<p>During the extravagance of the preceding reign, the construction of
a marble church had been commenced, after the magnificent designs of
Jardin, a French architect. It was less an object of devotion than of
pomp and decoration. In the same reign, when the state became deeply
indebted, and frugality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
was necessary, the court reduced the annual amount devoted to this
church to 20,000 dollars: it was deferring its completion for a century.
Struensee cut the knot: he put a stop to the works, broke the contracts
with the stone contractors in Norway, and offered Jardin, if he were
willing to remain, an annual salary of 300 dollars, which sum a pupil of
his would have rejected. The contractors naturally declared that they
were ruined: social economists complained that it was a disgrace to the
government to give up, for so slight a cause, a magnificent undertaking,
the expenses of which returned in a thousand ways to the Treasury:
artists protested against barbarism: and the zealots were scandalized at
the house of the Lord being deprived of a trifling sum compared with that
expended in the chase and playhouses.</p>

<p>Retrenchment in the administration was, however, even more necessary
than at court. Hence, in the first place, all those who had hitherto been
in the enjoyment of pensions from the king's privy purse, were ordered to
state their age, their position, and the services for which the pensions
had been granted, and a similar order was sent to the Board of Revenue
and the General Post Office. Many in consequence lost their pensions,
while those of others were reduced. It is true that several needy persons
were affected by this; but the changes, and especially the abolition of
franking, which had been scandalously misused by the officials, produced
savings and an augmented revenue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
The latter was greatly aided by a cabinet order to the effect that the
Sound dues, which had hitherto been paid into the king's privy purse,
would henceforth be handed over to the Treasury.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reductions effected in the king's household in this
way did not go so far as had been hoped, for the court cost more than
before, because Brandt consumed in his department all the savings made.
Masked and dress balls, pic-nics, the chase, a troupe of French actors,
the opera buffa, were all treated most profusely, and formed a revolting
contrast with the retrenchments which daily reduced some family to misery.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>However, no settled plan could be devised about a
better arrangement of the finances. Strangely enough,
no agreement could be arrived at as to the real amount
of the in-comings and out-goings. Gähler estimated
the annual crown receipts at 6,250,000 dollars, but
Rantzau at only 4,500,000 dollars. When Christian
VII. ascended the throne, the state debt amounted to
20,000,000 dollars, and, according to Gähler's calculations,
was now reduced to 13,980,000 dollars, but according
to Rantzau, only to 15,000,000 dollars. The
expenses amounted, according to Schimmelmann, to
only 4,154,650 dollars, but according to Rantzau to
fully 6,000,000. Nor could they agree as to the fundamental
principles of the financial system, although
the great majority, of the council of conferences decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
against any extra taxation or income tax. On May 29
the commission handed in its final report to the king,
and met for the last time on June 10.</p>

<p>On the same day as the privy commission of conferences
sent in its last report on financial matters, a
College of Finances was established, and the general
Board of Customs abolished. According to the regulations
for the new college, it was to consist of four
departments (1st, for Denmark; 2nd, for Norway;
3rd, for Schleswig-Holstein; and 4th, for Oldenburg).
Count von Holstein, Chief President of Copenhagen,
the bürgermeister of the capital, Thyge Rothe, Financial
Councillor Oeder, and Councillor of Justice
Struensee, were appointed by the king deputies of the
College of Finances.</p>

<p>Rothe had been a preceptor to Prince Frederick, but
afterwards retired to an estate which he obtained
through his wife. Though an esteemed writer in
verse and prose, he possessed more imagination than
common sense. <span class="smcap">Charles Augustus Struensee</span> was
an elder brother of the favourite, professor of mathematics
at the military school of Liegnitz, in Prussia,
and was well known as a writer on military subjects,
and as translator of the <cite>Rêveries</cite> of Maréchal de Saxe,
when he was appointed a Danish Councillor, on
November 13, 1669. Being now summoned by his
brother to Copenhagen, where he arrived at the close
of April, 1771, he attracted general attention, us the
near relative of the all-powerful cabinet secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Reverdil is willing to admit that the choice of
Oeder and Struensee for their present posts was not
improper, except from the fact of the latter's relationship.
Both were upright and learned, and both had
gained a good deal of information connected with their
new duties. Struensee had observed the administration
of the Prussian States; Oeder, while travelling to
study botany, had greatly reflected on the manner
in which countries were cultivated, or the faults connected
with the collection of taxes, and the oppression
exercised by the officials.</p>

<p>The arts and sciences also became an object of attention
to Struensee and his adherents. The Academy for
Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture at Charlottenborg,
was provided with fresh regulations, of a nature
to render it of more practical use. For this purpose, all
pupils who wished to devote themselves to the arts obtained
a gratuitous education, and the distribution of
large and small gold and silver medals, at the public exhibitions,
was promised as a reward to encourage merit.
In the same spirit, it was ordered that the Academy of
Soroe should in future be thrown open to the sons of
bourgeois as well as of the nobles. The intentions of
the government connected with the latter order were,
however, not carried out, because the regulations were
in direct opposition to the will of the regenerator of the
Academy, the celebrated Danish playwright Holberg.</p>

<p>As regards trade, the principle was laid down, that
factories which could not support themselves should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
not be maintained at the expense of the state. It was
therefore resolved no longer to carry on any manufacture
on royal account, and several silk mills were closed.
On the other hand, the greatest possible extension of
trade, by enlarging its liberties, was recognized as a
pressing necessity by the government, and many regulations
connected with this object were passed.</p>

<p>The government also provided public amusements
for the inhabitants of the capital, with the object of
inducing other wealthy families to take up their residence
at Copenhagen. The winter amusements consisted
principally of the theatres. At the court theatre
French performances were given every Tuesday and
Friday, to which not only men of rank and position,
but also respectable citizens, had free admission.
After the performance, they played at cards in
the queen's rooms, and cold refreshments were handed
to them.</p>

<p>The Danish theatre, however, which, as has been
stated, was under the direction of Brandt and Capellmeister
Sarti, was not only used for the performance
of German plays and Italian operas, but also for redoutes
and masquerades, for which free tickets of admission
were sent out, and on some occasions everybody
was allowed to attend, as in the case of the great
masquerade of December 18. At the same time there
was no lack of public concerts, at which foreign artistes
performed, and of performances by travelling posture-masters
and conjurors, among whom Brambilla greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
distinguished himself as rope-dancer, pantomimist, and
pyrotechnist.</p>

<p>Up to this time, certain portions of the Rosenborg
Palace garden had been closed against the public.
These gardens, as well as those of the palace of Frederiksberg,
adjoining the western suburb of Copenhagen,
were thrown open to everybody towards the
end of May; and on Sundays and holidays the regimental
bands played in the royal gardens and the
great market-places.</p>

<p>Rosenborg was the favourite abode of Christian IV.
When first erected, it stood outside the capital, and
was his summer residence when his royal duties forbade
his being at Frederiksborg. At the time when
Struensee threw the gardens open to the public, the
flower-beds still flourished under the care of an attentive
gardener. The hedges were clipped square, the
orange trees formed into the shape of balls, and four large
fountains threw their jets high into the air, and caught
them again in circular marble basins. A buffet was
erected in this garden, and the commission was granted
to a Mecklenburger of the name of Gabel, a protégé
of Struensee, who was afterwards permitted to open
a faro bank. The gardens were illuminated with
coloured lamps, especially the great grove near the
spring and the neighbouring alleys. At times fireworks
were let off, and it was a fine sight to see
the trees and the old palace illumined by the ascending
rockets, which threw a magic brilliancy over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
these memorials of past ages, to leave them the next
moment enveloped in the darkness of the grave.
The concerts at Rosenborg were frequently honoured
by the presence of the court, and the king and queen
were accustomed to take refreshments in the palace,
and then mingle with the crowd.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The zealots were very fierce in their denunciations
of these popular amusements. Formerly, they said,
the act of profaning royal mansions by clandestine
amours was considered a crime punishable with the
loss of a finger-joint, and Struensee did worse in turning
a royal garden into a scene of libertinism. It
must be allowed, that though the principal walks were
lit, the deepest gloom prevailed in the thickets, and
the gardens remained open till midnight. But the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parti prêtre</i> had a better cause of abuse in the faro
table, even though the Foundling Hospital shared the
profits of the bank. This was no justification for the
mistake committed by the favourite, and led his enemies
to spread a report that his great object was utterly
to corrupt morals, and make the whole people as licentious
as himself and his adherents.</p>

<p>On May 19, Struensee effected a reduction in the
army, which produced a most disagreeable impression
on the whole nation, and must be regarded as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of the principal causes of his rapid overthrow. This
was the abolition of the two squadrons of Royal
Horse Guards, composed of picked handsome men.
The Guards greatly annoyed the favourite, for several
of the officers were men of high birth, and had the
right of appearing at court when they pleased. This
suppression might be a useful economy, and the task
was already far advanced. Count de St. Germain,
when he became minister in 1762, found four squadrons
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du corps</i>, and two regiments of Foot
Guards. He reduced them to two squadrons and a
battalion, forming a single corps under the same commandant,
and wearing the same uniform. The nation
believed that this was the minimum, and that the
king could not be guarded by less than seven hundred
and twenty men. Struensee, however, abolished the
two squadrons by a stroke of the pen.</p>

<p>Those officers who could not be at once attached
to other cavalry regiments were placed on half-pay;
but the non-commissioned officers and privates received
nothing, as they had the option of entering the Foot
Guards. The latter mounted guard at the palace three
days after the order for disbanding the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du corps</i>
was made known. Struensee's enemies regarded this
step as an attack on the king's majesty and prestige,
and expressed their opinion loudly, especially when
this occurrence offered an opportunity for exposing
one of the weaknesses of Struensee's character. When
the Guards were returning to barracks from the parade,
where the king's order had been read to them, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
purpose of giving over their horses, Struensee met
them. Frightened by this most unexpected rencontre,
and believing that the Horse Guards had mutinied, he
retired in great haste, tore a leaf out of his pocket-book,
and wrote a few hurried lines in pencil to Count
Ahlefeldt, in which he sent in his resignation as cabinet
secretary to the king.</p>

<p>It can be easily imagined what a sensation this
event created when the report of it spread through
the city. Struensee himself, however, ought to have
learned through his discovery of his personal character,
that he was deficient in the most important quality
of a state reformer&mdash;an undaunted heart.</p>

<p>It was soon seen what was the cause of the disbandment
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du corps</i> when a cabinet order was
issued establishing a model corps, or what was called
the "flying body guard," which was to take the place
of the disbanded squadron, under the command of Colonel
Numsen, and be composed of detachments from
the different cavalry regiments. The reason alleged for
the change was, that these detachments would regularly
relieve one another; and as each would man&oelig;uvre
in presence of the king, the officers would all know
their master, and be known by him. Economy was
not the motive of the change, for these troops were
granted privileges, under pretext of the dearness of
food, which swallowed up all the savings. According
to Reverdil, Struensee's real object was to form the
cavalry himself; he was a good rider, and thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
would make a capital inspector-general. Nothing was
right but what he did himself; but, on this occasion,
he concealed his vanity by a variety of pretexts.</p>

<p>The next regulation for the army appeared to be
just, as it abolished all the privileges and precedence
of the officers of the corps of land cadets, the guards,
and the artillery, and placed them exactly on the same
footing as the other officers of the army and navy, but
it was evident that this order was intended as a humiliation
for the nobility. As Struensee was accustomed
to consult Colonel von Falckenskjold frequently
about the reforms in the army, his opponents spread
a report that the colonel had advised this measure
through jealousy of the privileged officers, but this was
a weak invention of the enemy. Falckenskjold himself
was one of the privileged officers, as commandant of
one of the king's own regiments, and possessed too
noble a character to entertain treacherous ideas. Moreover,
at the time of the projected reforms he was not in
Copenhagen, but had been sent on diplomatic business
to Petersburg.</p>

<p>One of the most brilliant phases of Struensee's short
government was certainly his desire to maintain the
independence of Denmark against foreign powers. His
attention was principally directed toward Russia, which
court he was well aware was very angry at the loss of
its influence in Copenhagen. In spite of the appointment
of Von der Osten as foreign minister, and his exertions
to remove the unfavourable impression at Petersburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the chagrin felt at the fancied insult was still
so great, that hostilities were even meditated. Threatening
reports of such an intention were spread about
Copenhagen, and Rantzau expressed himself loudly
about the Russian plans. But Struensee did not allow
himself to be led astray by this, and recognised too
fully the value of the territorial exchange for Denmark
to let himself be led into counter-demonstrations. He
merely consulted Von der Osten and Von Falckenskjold
about the disputes with the powerful neighbour in the
Baltic, and at length decided on sending Colonel von
Falckenskjold to Petersburg, as a man well respected
there, in order to arrange the misunderstanding. The
instructions which Falckenskjold received for this mission,
contained assurances of the friendly sentiments
of the King of Denmark, but also had a peculiar addition
in the offer to let the Danish fleet operate in future
with the Russian against any enemies of the latter
power.</p>

<p>Provided with letters of credit, written by the king
himself, and accompanied by Lieutenant von Beringskjold
(whose father, employed as a Danish spy in Russia
during the reign of Peter III., and then as a Russian
reporter in Denmark, had been ennobled by the Danish
court, and enriched by the Russian), Falckenskjold set
out from Copenhagen on May 21, and returned from
Petersburg early in the following August. From the
beginning he had doubted of any favourable result of
his negociations, and the result was nearly to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
effect. The Petersburg cabinet attached but little
value to Denmark's proffered alliance; but, through
Falckenskjold's representations, was induced to make
the reply, that they were ready to carry out the treaty
of 1768, if Bernstorff were recalled, and Von der Osten
and Rantzau-Ascheberg removed from the government.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
With these prospects the envoy returned to
Copenhagen, after convincing himself at St. Petersburg
that Prussia would employ every effort to prevent the
misunderstanding between Russia and Denmark from
being made up. Still the proposals for a renewal of
the alliance were so acceptable, that Falckenskjold believed
he had brought Struensee over to his way of
thinking, although the favourite hesitated about removing
Rantzau, to whom he fancied himself so greatly
indebted, until Falckenskjold represented to him the
impropriety of allowing himself to be made an instrument
of this adventurer's revenge. Struensee, however,
hesitated about giving any definitive explanation,
and merely expressed his satisfaction that Falckenskjold
had prevented an open breach with Russia.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the rumour of an impending attack on
Copenhagen was renewed. It was stated that the empress
was determined to bombard the city, and for
this purpose was equipping six ships of the line and
four frigates, which would immediately set sail from
Cronstadt. It was evident that this demonstration was
only designed to force the King of Denmark into getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
rid of Struensee. But the favourite was well
aware that Russia might have ships, but had not a
sufficient number of sailors to equip a fleet. Hence he
did not trouble himself much about the renewed report,
but satisfied himself with hastily fitting out three
ships of the line and two frigates, and giving orders to
build several bomb-ketches. This latter job was set
about so effectively at the naval docks, that, although
the order was only issued on March 29, two bomb-galleys
were launched on May 24, two more on June
16, and on June 29 a mortar hulk, although, at the
same time, men-of-war were being equipped to defend
the capital, for the expedition against the Algerines,
and as a convoy for the West Indiamen. All these
ships were manned with equal rapidity, for sailors
flocked into the capital from every part of the monarchy.
The whole turmoil of war, however, soon
disappeared again, as nothing more was heard about a
Russian fleet in the Baltic.</p>

<p>The court remained till June 6 at the palace of Christiansborg.
The festivities that took place here were
all arranged by Brandt, who felt quite in his element
while doing so, and never displayed any inclination to
interfere in affairs of state. But Struensee demanded
resolution, even in court matters, and acted on the
principle that, if a man wanted to reform an intriguing
court, it could not be effected with paternal indulgence.
Still he was frequently obliged to give way. At the
small court balls, natural merriment at first prevailed,
until a dancing-master, favoured by the Countess Holstein,
introduced pomp and art. That she was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
to effect this, although the king and queen did not care
fix formal dances, was ascribed to the power which
she possessed over Brandt.</p>

<p>As regards the theatre, both the king and queen
preferred comedies to tragedies, and Struensee demanded
that their Majesties' wishes should be carried
out; more especially, as there were no good tragic
actors. He was also of opinion that the cheapest
troupe of comedians was the best, and that the music
required at the performances could be entrusted to
the regimental bands. Brandt, on the contrary, entertained
different views: he wished to introduce another
and purer taste at court, and did not like to run the
risk of being laughed at by foreign guests at court
festivities. This was allowed him, on condition that
he undertook the most responsible duty of being with
the king day and night. He dressed him, which formerly
the valet and Von Warnstedt had done; and
had to introduce all those persons who were allowed
admission to the king, but report to Struensee everything
that occurred during the interview.</p>

<p>The connexion between the king and his chamberlain,
however, was not that of a master with his servant,
but exactly like that between two men of equal
rank; for King Christian would not have any ceremony,
and desired perfect freedom of action on the
part of his immediate <em>entourage</em>. Thus his most gracious
Majesty had behaved to Holck and Warnstedt,
and he expected the same from Brandt. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
king's expressed wish, that any one who was continually
about him should forget that he was the king. Whenever
Brandt attempted to show his Majesty the reverence
which became a subject, the king at once ridiculed
him, by bowing to him with a sarcastic "your
most obedient servant." But Brandt found no pleasure
in this free and easy style, and was generally
dissatisfied with his position, which forced him to be
constantly with the king, and deprived him of every
opportunity to enjoy the society of his beloved Frau
von Holstein. This amour even rendered him indifferent
to Struensee, with whom he was angry besides,
because he did not consider himself honoured in proportion
to his fancied merits; for it had been he who
recommended Struensee to Holck as travelling doctor,
and had satisfied Bernstorff as regarded him. Lastly,
Brandt was annoyed at his and his lady-love's repeated
heavy losses at cards, although he himself had insisted
on high stakes, and the king and queen liked the fascinating
game of loo. And even though Brandt's losses
amounted to nearly 2,000 dollars in a single month,
still, what he lost in this way was amply made up by
royal presents. He received, in the first instance, a
gratification of 10,000, and afterwards 50,000, dollars
from the king's privy purse.</p>

<p>When the winter amusements were at an end, the
summer days were employed for excursions to the
palace of Frederiksborg. On June 6, their Majesties
removed to Hirschholm, after being present on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
previous day at the last races of the year. This palace
and the park now became the scene of incessant festivities,
concerts, balls, French plays, and hunting parties,
succeeding each other rapidly; but the queen's interesting
situation did not allow her to take an active
part in them. The king drove at times to town to
attend the French plays, but he was in such a weak
state of health, that, by the advice of Berger, his physician,
he began taking cold baths again in June, and
continued to do so till the following September. The
physician paid the greatest attention to the king, and
sent in a daily report to Struensee about his patient's
condition and the progress of his cure. That stimulants
were given the king to enable him to carry on
his amorous excesses, is untrue, even though Landgrave
Charles, his brother-in-law, states the fact.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Queen Juliana Maria and her son Frederick had retired
on May 24 to Fredensborg, where they lived in
great seclusion, and left the palace as rarely as they
received visitors. Princess Charlotte Amelia, the benefactress
of the poor, was staying at the palace of
Frederiksborg.</p>

<p>The royal couple had been residing a month at
Hirschholm, when Queen Caroline Matilda was delivered
of a daughter, at eleven on the morning of
July 7. A military and a naval officer at once conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the glad tidings to Copenhagen, where the birth
of a princess was announced to the people from the
balcony of the Christiansborg, and commemorated by
salvos of artillery from the ramparts and the arsenal,
and by the playing of trumpets from the Town Hall
and the church towers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Struensee assisted in the accouchement
with Berger,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and no other physicians were
afterwards called in. This gave fresh animation to
the impertinent speeches and remarks which had long
been made, and they became the more serious because
it was said that they were frequently heard at Fredensborg.
Here they could no longer retain the quality
of a harmless satire, which people easily forget: they
were repeated and dipped in gall by persons of rank,
who only too willingly listened to them, and in whose
hands they might turn into dangerous weapons. Here,
too, they were no longer the frivolous gossip of an impotent
mob, but might give rise to serious measures.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The royal patient progressed so favourably that she
was able to suckle her child; and on July 22, the
twenty-first birthday of the young queen, the newborn
princess was christened at Hirschholm, with the
names of Louisa Augusta,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> after the late queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Denmark and H.R.H. the Princess Dowager of
Wales. The sponsors present were his Majesty the
King of Denmark, with his brother, Prince Frederick,
and the Dowager Queen, Juliana Maria.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>While these events were taking place at court, a
change occurred in the government, which was followed
by the most weighty consequences, and was an
unique instance in Danish history.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, Struensee had been <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maître
des requêtes</i>, with the title of Councillor of Conference,
and had occupied, as we have seen, the Mezzanine, in
Christiansborg Palace. But we have also seen that,
in this capacity, he governed the state and the court.
The king gave his assent to everything that Struensee
proposed; and the latter had hitherto employed
this influence in carrying out useful reforms in the
government and legislature. At the same time, however,
he obtained large sums for himself and his friends
out of the resources of the state. Although he had no
expenses of his own, not even for the banquets he gave,
he received, a couple of months after his appointment
as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maître des requêtes</i>, a present of 10,000 dollars from
the king, and obtained the same sum for Brandt. But
not satisfied with this, he proposed, in April, that what
was called the "treasure," or a sum of money set apart
for unforeseen expenses, should be paid into the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
exchequer, and then obtained an order to pay 250,000
dollars of this amount into the privy purse, which was
under his sole control. But this large sum had been
reduced, by the end of May, to 118,000 dollars, the
deficit having been expended in presents,&mdash;Struensee
and Brandt receiving 100,000 dollars to divide between
them; and they did so at a time when so many salaries
and pensions were reduced.</p>

<p>But it was now shown that Struensee would not
be satisfied with being the favourite of the king and
queen, and having decided influence in all affairs of
state. Hence he induced the king to appoint him, on
July 14, 1771, Privy Cabinet Minister, with an authority
which no subject had ever before held in Denmark.
The document is so remarkable, that I quote it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in extenso</i>:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote><p class="center"><em>To the &mdash;&mdash; College.</em></p>

<p>Having appointed Master of Requests Struensee my
Privy Cabinet Minister, I have prescribed to him, by
an order under my own hand, the following points,
which he must observe in drawing up cabinet orders:</p>

<p>1. All orders which I may give him orally shall be
drawn up by him in accordance with my meaning;
and he shall lay them before me for signature, or issue
them in my name, under the cabinet seal.</p>

<p>2. All orders addressed to a college, on the representation
of another college, shall be drawn up by him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and no longer be effected through an order in the college,
or through the "communication."</p>

<p>3. An extract from the cabinet orders issued shall
be laid before me weekly for approval.</p>

<p>4. The cabinet orders issued in this way shall have
the same validity as those drawn up by my hand.
They shall be immediately obeyed, both by the colleges
and subaltern officials, in case there is no royal
order or resolution to the contrary; in which case it
will be at once reported to the cabinet. In all other
cases, the colleges and departments must send to me
the contents of the order and a report of its execution.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>In consequence, this is made known to the &mdash;&mdash;
College; and it is ordered punctually to obey the
points affecting the college herein contained, and make
them known, for the same purpose, to its subordinate
officials.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smallcp">Christian.</span></p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">STRUENSEE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirschholm</span>, <i>July 15, 1771</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may notice here the favourite's ignorance of
forms. When his patent as Count was granted him,
he would have countersigned it himself, had not Hoier,
who was present, warned him. But the royal order
appointing him prime minister was communicated to
the departments and the ministers of the foreign courts
by copies countersigned by himself alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>As Reverdil very justly remarks, the king, after declaring to all
Europe that he intended himself to govern, suddenly delegated his whole
power to one man; and it was conferred with less pomp and formality than
would have been used in former times with an order of the Treasury.
No one attested to having been present at so important a deliberation
except the man who was the subject of it. Struensee suddenly found
himself transformed from an officer of the palace into a grand vizier,
and invested with greater power than had ever been granted to the
chancellors, or even the lieutenant-generals of the kingdom,&mdash;known
in the time of the aristocracy by the name of grand masters. Thus was
accomplished what Struensee had announced at the outset of his career.
He had told Reverdil's faithful friend, Hoier, and probably many other
persons, that everything was vicious in the government of the state, and
that he would not leave one stone of it upon the other.</p>

<p>The nation, revolted by so rapid a fortune, by this
unlimited power entrusted to a stranger and a parvenu,
considered it a crime on his part to accept it; and even
a crime foreseen by the regulations of the <cite>Lex Regia</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the only unchangeable law in the kingdom. Article
twenty-six of this law enjoins the future kings to
defend their hereditary rights, and never allow them
to be encroached on; declares null and void any
powers granted to the prejudice of the royal authority;
and proclaims those who had obtained them
guilty of high treason. It was asserted that the man
whose orders were to be obeyed without any external
proof that they emanated from the king, had arrogated
a portion of the sovereign authority; and this interpretation,
forced though it was, was seriously alleged
hereafter.</p>

<p>It is plain that the rescripts and orders of the government
were, as before, drawn up in accordance
with article seven of the <cite>Lex Regia</cite> in the king's name
and under his seal; and Struensee could not be responsible
because the king did not always think proper to
sign with his own hand, as the article demands. But
even the signature in the king's name could not be regarded
as an encroachment on the king's autocracy;
for, by article twenty-six the king is left at liberty
either to sign orders himself, or to let them be signed
in his name by other persons, whenever he thinks proper.
That the <cite>Lex Regia</cite> also does not regard the autograph
signature of the king as a material component
of autocracy is clearly seen from article nine, in which
it is prescribed that in cases when the king is not of
age, the regent shall sign in his name, but the royal
authority remain undiminished. Lastly, it is proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
that the letter of the law had not hitherto been so explained
as to render the royal signature of such consequence
as the drawing up of the deed in his name, by
the fact that not only the colleges, but also officials up
to very recent times, made known the king's will in
his name but without his signature. Yet it is a very
difficult question to solve, whether Struensee did not
misapply the king's confidence by issuing orders that
differed from those which the monarch had given him.</p>

<p>Struensee's best friends were shocked by the sudden
display of his favour revealed in this new appointment.
Thus, Von Berger, the physician in ordinary, and other
respected men at court, expressed their dissatisfaction
at Struensee's unreflecting step. Even Lieutenant-General
von Gähler, though usually devoted to the
favourite, felt aggrieved, though it is but fair to allow
that he had sunk in the daring reformer's favour by
opposing the disbandment of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du corps</i>.</p>

<p>It was not stated in the royal proclamation what
rank was to be connected with the new post of a
cabinet minister, but people at court already began
addressing Struensee by the title of Excellency. Scarce
a week after this elevation, another took place, by which
Brandt also profited. Both men were raised to the
rank of Danish Counts on July 30, 1771, but the Latin
diplomas, in which they were justified to call their
ancestors up to the third generation Counts and Countesses,
were not drawn up till September 30.</p>

<p>The coat of arms selected by Struensee, and engraved
on the cabinet seal, was a remarkable allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
to his regency and system of government. The escutcheon
(symbolical of the state) was divided into
five fields, the centre one of which represented a sailing
vessel (the symbol of commerce) with a crown
over it, typical of the monarch and the persons representing
him. The first and fourth quarters displayed
four rivers (exports and imports idealized) on a field
<em>or</em>, which was the symbol of Denmark, rich in corn,
and Norway, abounding in metal, wood, and fish. In
the third and second quarters was a crown surrounded
with palm leaves (the symbol of peace and victory)
and two crossed keys (the image of authority and
might) on a field <em>azure</em>, which allegorically typified
fidelity and constancy. Below the coat of arms was
the royal crown with the badge of the Matilda order,
surrounded by a laurel wreath (the symbol of fortune,
joy, and honour), from which flowed two rivers running
round the chief escutcheon (the state), supported
by two beavers (the representatives of industry and
architecture), and guarded by bourgeois helmets (emblems
of national armament), counts' crowns (the
symbol of the servant of the state), and an owl holding
a key in its mouth (as allegories of thought and
reflection). Above the whole was displayed between
two eagle wings (the symbols of power, strength, and
victory) a man-of-war in full sail (typical of the navy),
and above this, again, a suspended crown, surrounded
by palm branches (the type of peace).<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Brandt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
on the other hand, took the seal of his ancestor, Councillor
of the Exchequer Peter Brandt, as his coat of
arms.</p>

<p>No estates were connected with the dignity of the
new counts. It was certainly reported that the large
domains of Wemmetofte and Wallô, in Seeland, were
intended for Struensee, and other estates for Brandt.
But that Struensee was of a different opinion was
proved by the answer he gave to a letter which Brandt
wrote him on this subject. He said that if the king
really intended so exaggerated a mark of kindness for
him, he should in no way promote it, but, on the contrary,
oppose it.</p>

<p>Within two short years, Struensee had made really
gigantic strides on the slippery path of court favour.
By his elevation to the rank of a privy cabinet
minister and of count, fourteen months after his appointment
as reader to the king and cabinet secretary
to the queen, he had attained the highest post in
the kingdom. Possessing the unbounded confidence of
the most absolute monarch in Europe, he stood immediately
next to the throne, and the world gazed in
amazement upon his fortune and his reforms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>In the new period commencing with Struensee's
cabinet ministry, so many changes and improvements
no longer took place. The necessity for them, indeed,
was not so great, as reforms had been undertaken in
nearly every branch of the administration. In the
highest government colleges better management and
simplification, and a more rapid settlement of business,
had been introduced. The finances were managed on
a fixed plan; all the various in-comings and out-goings
of the state were entrusted to a single direction, and
retrenchments introduced to pay off the state debts.
The administration of justice had been partially improved,
and the privileges of the nobles restricted. Men
of birth and of no birth were henceforth equally obliged
to work their way up to the highest offices from the
lowest round of the ladder. Catholics and reformers
were allowed to worship as they pleased, and religious
liberty existed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>, if not by law. We may assume
that the clergy of the strictly Lutheran country were
not particularly edified by this, but no one dared to
oppose it openly, and hence the only measure taken
was drawing up a private list of the supposed attacks
on the state religion. The liberty of the press knew
no bounds, but was shamefully employed in disgraceful
attacks upon its founders. For people not only
ventured openly to abuse many of Struensee's useful
reforms, but made the most impudent attacks both
on the minister and their reigning Majesties. Struensee,
however, considered it beneath his dignity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
punish these attacks, and did not even take the
slightest trouble to discover the authors.</p>

<p>Justiz-rath Struensee, the favourite's brother, had by
this time attained an influential position. He was at
the head of the German Chancery of Finances, but in
spite of his valuable qualities, had a high opinion of himself,
and was evidently striving for more extended influence,
both on his own account and that of the college
to which he belonged. He wrote in July to a friend,
that he was really, if not nominally, the sole manager
of the finances of the monarchy. He also strove to
obtain the post of a Controller-General of the Finances;
but though his brother placed great confidence in him,
he opposed the establishment of such a high office.
The Mint and the Bank were, as a compensation,
placed entirely under the management of Justiz-rath
Struensee, and he conducted these important institutions
skilfully and honestly. As director of the Mint,
he coined very handsome <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">christians d'or</i> and species
ducats, but also meditated the erroneous plan of publicly
letting the salt and tobacco trades as monopolies.
Fortunately for the country, the catastrophe
that ensued soon after prevented the execution of this
scheme.</p>

<p>One of the most humane ameliorations during Struensee's
ministry was the abolition of what was called
"the sharp examination," by which a confession was
extorted from any prisoner against whom there was
strong evidence by employing the dagg, or knout. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
the order issued to this effect it was stated that the
king would sooner let a criminal escape than see one
possibly innocent man ill-treated.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Foreign affairs toward the close of 1771 stood much
on the same footing as in the past. The greatest cordiality
subsisted with Sweden. Chamberlain Baron von
Gyldencrone was appointed envoy at Stockholm, and instructed
not to interfere in Swedish home affairs, and
not to act like his predecessor upon an understanding
with England and Russia, but to join the policy
of Sweden and France. Moreover, Count Joachim
Göttsche von Moltke was sent as envoy extraordinary
to the Swedish court, to congratulate Gustavus III.
on his accession. As a present for the new king,
Moltke took with him a fine apple-grey saddle-horse
from the royal stud, with which Gustavus was so
pleased, that he resolved to ride it at his approaching
coronation.</p>

<p>A present was also made the King of France, consisting
of nineteen Icelandic hawks, for Struensee displayed
a predominant attachment for the courts of
France and Sweden. As a return for these sentiments,
the ministers of these two courts were on very
friendly relations with him, and alone of all the foreign
envoys attended his levees. Struensee behaved with
great coldness and reserve to the newly appointed English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>minister, Colonel Keith, as he had done to his
predecessor, Gunning, and did not even offer him the
ordinary courtesy. But he behaved in a precisely
similar manner to the Russian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i>, Filosofow's
successor.</p>

<p>We can easily understand that Struensee had raised
himself an ample crop of foes by the numerous reforms
he had undertaken in the government. The nobility,
owing to their traditional belief that they had a right
to the most profitable offices, were excessively annoyed
that the privy council was abolished, that presidential
posts were not filled up, that orders and rank no
longer possessed their former value, and that people
of <em>bourgeois</em> origin exercised an influence in the government.
The officials dismissed with no pension,
or a very small one, were indignant at the humiliation
and the loss of income. The abolition of the numerous
Church holidays, and the alleged desecration of the
Sabbath; the order that the church of the Frederick's
Hospital, and the chapel of the Convalescents' Home at
Sölleröd, near Copenhagen, should be converted into
wards for venereal patients; the rare appearance of the
court at church; and lastly, the changes made in the
law, by which the mothers of illegitimate children were
no longer punished; marriages within the hitherto prohibited
degrees were allowed;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and a charge of adultery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
could only be brought by the offended party,&mdash;all
this had aroused the whole of the clergy and many
laymen against Struensee. The pietists even went so
far as to declare the hard winter of 1770, and the bad
harvest of 1771, a punishment from Heaven for these
offences against the Christian religion. The income
of the industrial classes was lessened, because many
families who lived expensively had quitted the capital;
poor persons complained about the use of stamps and
augmented taxes, and the sailors and dockyard-men
were offended at having been excluded from all the
grand doings on the king's birthday, and the loss of
their perquisites in the shape of chips, &amp;c., which
they carried home for firewood.</p>

<p>Many persons even believed that Struensee entertained
far higher plans, and saw in him a nascent
Cromwell. All patriots disapproved of the contradictory
conduct of the government, which was constantly
talking of retrenchment, and yet, at the same
time, threw away large sums in the prosecution of the
useless war against the Dey of Algiers. In addition,
many persons were grieved that ladies who had a bad
reputation still possessed great influence in the highest
circles, although, by a public promise, offices of state
were no longer to be filled up by favour and recommendation,
but solely through ability and merit. All
Danish patriots felt most insulted, because the cabinet
minister still thought it not worth his trouble to acquire
the Danish language, and that all the government
decrees were issued in German, though everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
knew that the king both spoke and wrote Danish.
Not only were the cabinet orders drawn up in
Danish, but the colleges, which had formerly reported
in Danish, were now forced to have their reports to
the cabinet translated into German, so that the minister
might understand them. The Danish Chancery
and the Admiralty, it is true, still continued to draw
up their reports in Danish; but it was also said that
the minister took no trouble to discover their contents,
but merely read a short German <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">précis</i> which
was laid before him, and then issued a resolution in
German, which had to be translated into Danish in the
colleges, if found necessary to be brought to the public
knowledge. Petitioners who wished to apply to the
cabinet generally had their letters translated into German,
because they thought that a Danish petition
would not be heeded; but these translations were
often so unsuccessful, that their meaning could hardly
be understood. In excuse for Struensee's offences
against the national pride of the Danes, it may be
alleged, however, that several of the ministers before
him did not understand Danish. The same was the
case with Schulin, the recently-dismissed Bernstorff,
Berkentin, Ahlefeldt, and many high officials, both
military and civil, but never in the Admiralty.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Many men of position, who had either caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Struensee's summons to court, or had been devoted
to him, became gradually indisposed, and, at last, even
hostile to him. At the head of the latter stood Count
Rantzau-Ascheberg. If there was any man in the
kingdom from whom Struensee might justly think he
had nothing to fear, it was Rantzau: but he was detested
by him. This hatred sprung up on the day
when Struensee, recognising the falsity of all the
views he had heard in his conversations with the
count at Altona, and how much the count mingled
passion with a few flashes of genius, entirely neglected
his advice. Rantzau, far from sharing the power of a
minister whom he regarded as his creature, was given
the third post in the Council of the Generalty.
Thus, after so many successful intrigues, after succeeding
in routing his principal enemies, and commanding
for a short period, he saw himself the client
of a doctor, and neglected by the man whom he had
trained: he was reduced, like him, to be the mark of
public hatred, without enjoying the credit, and gathering
the favours of every description, which he had
expected from this ungrateful man.</p>

<p>Rantzau was probably most indignant because
Struensee refused to pay his heavy debts, and even
intimated that he had no influence over the cabinet.
Rantzau was, in truth, in great difficulties, and yet
retained his taste for extravagance. He fancied that
he had at least found a right to live at peace, while
his creditors did not leave him alone, even amid the
faction to which he belonged. The revenue of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
patrimonial estate of Ascheberg scarcely sufficed to
pay the interest of his own debts and those of his
father. In the hope that, at the worst, court presents
would enable him to liquidate them, he suggested a
new law, which would afford the nobles a sure protection
against their creditors. His duns becoming importunate,
he wished to employ his right as a gentleman
of Holstein, and send them to do their best and
worst on his estates. The creditors asked the advice
of the Chancery, which answered, with the knowledge
of the cabinet, that his person was no more inviolate
than his property. Rantzau compared himself to a
hare whom the hunters had pursued to its form.</p>

<p>Disappointed in all his expectations, Rantzau began
to speculate on Struensee's downfall, and for this purpose
made common cause with the two colonels, Von
Köller and Von Sames, who were also greatly in debt.
He even sent his tool, Beringskjold, to negotiate with
Count von Bernstorff, who was the idol of the patriots,
and whom his disgrace had rendered very popular.
Bernstorff at first listened very attentively, as long as
the conversation turned on the bad government of the
state, and the hope of an accommodation with Russia,
but at the name of the Count von Rantzau he at once
broke off the interview. "The count is well aware,"
he replied, "that I cannot trust to him, or enter into
any affair in which he mixes himself up."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>Rantzau next turned his attention to the watchful
Queen Juliana Maria, whom, though at first turned
against him, and suspicious of his designs, he soon
won over by his cajolery. Still he did not quite trust
the royal lady, because he had himself helped to
transfer the power at Petersburg to other hands, and
had been poorly rewarded for doing so.</p>

<p>Struensee's next important enemy was Lieutenant-General
von Gähler, with whom he had formerly stood
on intimate terms, and who had greatly assisted in
overthrowing the old form of government, but had
been indisposed toward the cabinet minister since his
appointment. Yet there was no open breach between
the two men, for the general and his wife, who had
both received the Order of Matilda, belonged to the
queen's immediate <em>entourage</em>.</p>

<p>Von Berger, the physician in ordinary, and Councillor
of Legation Sturtz, also formerly adherents of
Struensee, were now becoming more and more estranged
from him. Sturtz's dissatisfaction dated from
the downfall of Bernstorff, with whom he maintained a
regular correspondence; but though he was displeased
with the favourite, he equally detested Rantzau, in
whom he saw a personal foe.</p>

<p>But even the man who owed everything to Struensee,
whom the latter had made what he now was at court&mdash;Count
Brandt&mdash;was not at all a trustworthy friend.
Having long been tired of his position at court, he wrote
to Struensee, and proposed to him to appoint Colonel
von Falckenskjold in his place as permanent attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
on the king. At the same time, he applied personally
to Von Falckenskjold, and offered him his post and a
sum of 20,000 dollars. But the colonel again declined,
even though Struensee urged his acceptance, alleging
his invincible repugnance for court offices. They
therefore resolved to recall Reverdil, whom the king
liked, and who was a mutual friend of Brandt and
Struensee, and appoint him reader and librarian to the
king.</p>

<p>During the king's journey in 1768, Reverdil heard
from several quarters that his ex-master spoke of him
without bitterness, and with esteem. Schumacher,
Reverdil's successor in the post of cabinet secretary,
an honest man and no courtier, solicited his predecessor
to pay his court at Paris or Strasburg. Reverdil
heard from all quarters that the king, since his return,
was entirely changed, that he had corrected his causticity,
and dismissed those who had an audience quite
satisfied. All this induced Reverdil to write the
king a letter of congratulation on his return to his
states, and he learned that this letter was favourably
received, and that the king would have answered it
had he not been dissuaded from doing so by Holck.
When this favourite was dismissed, Reverdil received
an autograph letter from his Majesty, in which he
stated that he had not forgotten Reverdil's good
services, and begged him to transmit any reflections
which his retirement had suggested to him.</p>

<p>Not receiving any further orders, Reverdil remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
quiet till he was surprised by a letter from Struensee,
to the effect that the king desired his return; that he
wished to resume with him the operation of enfranchising
the serfs, and to employ him in drawing up
other laws he projected, and that Reverdil had only
to propose his conditions. Reverdil raised some objections,
which gave him time to consult a friend in
Copenhagen, in whom he placed the most perfect confidence,
and who had been promoted by Struensee, and
to ask the advice of Count von Bernstorff, who had such
cause to complain of the favourite. The answers were
precisely the contrary of what might have been expected.
The man promoted by Struensee sent a long
list of persons removed, transferred, and dismissed, in
less than a year, and gave Reverdil to understand that
he need not calculate on greater stability. Bernstorff,
on the other hand, urged him to return. The letter
is in every respect worthy of quotation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of everything I have hitherto seen of Struensee
nothing has so much surprised and struck me, sir, as
the letter written to you, for it is the only one of his
actions and measures that has caused me pleasure. I
confess that I did not at all expect it. You are aware
of the reasons which persuaded me that, far from recalling
you, you were one of the men whose absence
would be most desired. I see that I was mistaken,
but I do not see the causes of my error, and though
I have reflected during the two or three days that
have elapsed since the receipt of your letter, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
discover them. If I could flatter myself that they
had changed their plans, that their intentions had become
pure, that they were seeking in good faith to
revive the mind and the heart; that they consented to
share merit and confidence; that they had determined
to reopen a door, hitherto triply bolted against those
who have not taken an oath of fidelity in their favour,
and adopted their deplorable principles; if, I say, I
could conceive any shadow of a hope of this nature,
I could understand the invitation that has been made
you as the most natural, most just, and best conceived
thing in the world; but I do not see in the other measures
that are daily taken, anything authorising me to
form such an opinion, or anything announcing an alteration
in the maxims hitherto established and followed.
Favour, credit, politics, and administration,
are still founded on principles diametrically opposed to
yours and to your way of thinking. What, then, can
be the object that determines them to recall you who
are free, virtuous, and humane; you, who, thinking as
you do, cannot and will not play the part of a silent
witness of the scenes which may take place in your
presence, and to bring you nearer the person of a king
who, in his heart, esteems you more than all those
who surround him, and from whom, moreover, they
keep every thinking and feeling being aloof with an
exaggerated affectation? It is true, and I do this
justice to the favourite, and those who share his confidence,
that their intentions are sincere in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the liberty of the serfs, for this liberty does not cross
any of their views. Hence, this is a good thing they
have resolved to do, the more securely because, having
resolved mortally to afflict the other orders of the
state, they are seeking a support in the affection of the
people and the troops. It is very possible that in this
respect they sincerely desire the aid of your zeal and
information; but can they imagine that you will be
satisfied with sharing with the members of the commission
already established the painful labour of the
infinite arrangements and details of this operation, and
applaud the rest of their man&oelig;uvres? I repeat, that
I do not at all understand it, unless Divine Providence,
which has possibly destined you to recall the claims
of virtue and humanity at a spot where they are only
remembered to be jeered at, and which gains its ends
even by the ministration of its most avowed enemies,
has ordered their prevailing passions to fall asleep,
and prepare the way for your return. This idea is
the sole one which I like, and which I believe I ought
to cling to. Please Heaven that the event may justify
it.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, from what I have just told you, that
my information will be of but slight use to you, and
that my heart, filled with esteem, tenderness, and confidence
for you, could not venture to advise your
return to the unfortunate country to which I am
alluding: but that it passionately desires that, without
its advice, you may form the resolution of doing so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
If there is, in these deplorable conjunctures, a man who
is capable of being useful to the king, and through him
to the state, it is yourself. But God alone knows, as
yet, whether He has granted this succour to a prince,
so long the object of our affection, and now of our
tears. On this point, I am unable to form any opinion.
Still, without fear of committing myself, I can applaud
what you have hitherto done, and the measures you
have taken. Your friend and mine, the elder Carsten,
who has remained pure amid the corruption, will tell
you more. He sees things closely, and being, perhaps,
a little less affected and touched than myself, he will
represent to you more fully that of which I can only
afford you a glimpse, and which my mental emotion
prevents me from expressing more clearly. He will,
above all, counsel you to preserve your liberty in a
country where the philosophic tone is to preach licence
in morals and despotism, in every case where it is important
for men not to depend on the will of another:
and it is in this sole hint that I sum up all the advice
you have requested me to give you. Go to Copenhagen,
appear at court, but do not enter into engagements,
till you have reconnoitred the ground for yourself.
If you can do good, do not refuse to do it to a
country that needs it, and may Heaven deign to grant
you the merit and glory of it. But, if you see that
the means are refused you, do no allow yourself to be
drawn into any subaltern, doubtful, and odious employment,
directed by harsh and evil-doing natures. Do
not suffer your name to be associated with those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
men, about whom the nation is already weeping, and
posterity will weep for a long time.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear sir, that I brave the risks of the
post, in order, faithfully, to respond to the confidence
with which you honour me, and to carry out the duties
of the friendship I have vowed to you. This motive
obliges me to add one word to my long letter. Among
the number of unfortunate men who believe themselves
so happy now, because they have the power and
pleasure of rendering others wretched every day, you
will find two, who call themselves your friends: if
they were ever worthy of being so, it is not for me to
decide; but what I can not and must not conceal from
you, is, that they are no longer so, and do not deserve
to bear the name:<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> you will recognise the truth of my
remarks when you see them.</p>

<p>"May my fears be unfounded, and be proved false
by the result! But I am afraid lest the answer you
are expecting from the favourite may not be such as
you have the right to have; and that, falling back into
his usual character, he may impede rather than facilitate
your return; I impatiently long to hear that I am
deceived.</p>

<p>"It will be pleasanter to me to see you again than I
am able to express. Grant me and mine this pleasure,
and be assured that you have no warmer friend or
more faithful servant than myself, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"At Grabow, near Borstel, June 9, 1771."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reverdil thought it advisable to accept all Bernstorff's
prejudices against the favourite. Some of the
arrangements Struensee had made and dictated, seemed
to him useful and as announcing good intentions, but
the advice of the ex-minister was no less wise, and he
resolved to follow it. Hence, the sole conditions he
made were, permission to return home whenever he
thought proper, and that the king should pay his
travelling expenses both ways.</p>

<p>Reverdil had finished about half his journey when
he learned that Struensee and Brandt had been created
counts, and that the former had been appointed cabinet
minister, with unlimited power. Had he not gone
so far, he would have turned back. He was well acquainted
with the king's character: every favour the
latter granted was a title to his hatred, and he never
failed to be jealous of the credit, dignities, and presents
which his favourites extorted from him. Moreover, as
he advanced, Reverdil met <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> better informed persons,
who told him details of the worst possible augury.</p>

<p>In the duchies, Reverdil heard a number of reports,
some of which proved to be true, but the thing that
struck him most, was the horror which the names of
Struensee and Brandt inspired. Public hatred could
not be more excited or more universal. "They had
transformed the court into a poisonous cavern, and
filled the provinces with disgraced and unhappy men:
nothing was safe from their sacrilegious hands, and,
ere long, the throne and the altar would succumb in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
their turn. They had overthrown a negotiation from
which the country expected its safety for future ages;
while under the pretext of reform they reduced thousands
of families to want, they squandered the fruit
of these savings in profusion and scandalous excesses.
Not satisfied with displaying the most depraved habits,
they turned morality into derision, and sought to corrupt
it. Such horrible conduct brought down on the
nation the chastisements of Heaven. And by what
means had they seized the power and ensured impunity?
By shamelessly dishonouring the king's bed, and introducing
their vile posterity in the place of the pure
blood of Oldenburg. After dishonouring the king,
they held him besieged, and allowed no one to approach
him, save their minions, in order to degrade him, and
keep honest men from his familiarity. He was generally
left alone with two boys, one a negro, and the
other picked up in the streets."</p>

<p>Some persons went further, and declared that their
prince was ill-treated, and that he was governed by
terror; others, that his reason was affected by drugs;
the majority stated, however, that the absurd report of
his imbecility was spread with sinister views against
his person and the state.</p>

<p>At Schleswig, Reverdil had a private interview with
the Princess Dowager of Culmbach, sister of the Prince
of Brunswick-Bevern, whose husband was Christian's
great-uncle. She spoke with grief of the king's
wretched state, which she stated to have grown much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
worse since the tour of 1767. His remarks, she said,
having no sense or coherence, produced the worst idea
of his usual society. This lady and the Prince of
Hesse and his court talked infinitely to Reverdil about
the scandal produced in the province by the bevy that
followed the king. The queen travelling in a man's
dress, the impertinences of the favourites, their familiarity
with the king and queen, the ignoble air of the
court, had caused them an astonishment from which
they had not yet recovered.</p>

<p>When Reverdil arrived at Hirschholm, the first
person he saw was Brandt. He told the new comer
of the king's wretched mental condition; the necessity
he had, more than ever, of a constant companion, and
the honour he destined for Reverdil by giving him this
office. He had had some debates on this subject, he
added, with Struensee, who had destined Reverdil for
office, but the latter must promise to drive out every
day with the king. Reverdil agreed to do so; but did
not thank Brandt for the post which he designed for
him. The king and Brandt had long grown weary of
each other, and were continually quarrelling. Struensee
felt the necessity of separating them, and had
given the king the choice of two or three names: Reverdil
was preferred, and that was the secret of his recall.</p>

<p>Reverdil was presented to their Majesties in the
circle, and invited to dinner at their table. His reception
was most flattering; the queen spoke to him
kindly, and the king addressed the ordinary remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
to him, nothing revealing his malady. After dinner,
the gentlemen on duty introduced the new comer to a
private audience with the king. The latter referred
to Reverdil's dismissal, and threw the blame on Holck,
but added, that the tutor had wearied him by urging him
to gain the love of his subjects; that, at that period, he
did not wish to be beloved, &amp;c. With this exception,
nothing in the conversation displayed his lunacy; and
it did not appear that he had been taught beforehand
what to say. This fact proves that public rumour was
unjust to the favourites, for it was generally believed
that the king was guarded, and that no one reached
him without having been prepared, and making a promise
what he would talk about.</p>

<p>On the next day after Reverdil's arrival, the king
and he took the promised drive with Brandt. Our authority
gives a most sarcastic account of Brandt's behaviour
during the drive: how he occupied the entire
back of the carriage, with one of his elbows out of the
window to announce his presence to passers-by. The
poor king was crouched up in a corner, with a sad and
constrained air, and appeared relieved when they returned
home. Reverdil felt the greatest pity for him,
and, on the spot, accepted Brandt's offer to leave him
to drive out alone in future with the king.</p>

<p>Reverdil remained by himself in the royal apartments
with the monarch. His mania, which he concealed
from some persons, and which even the physicians in
daily attendance on him had not yet noticed, began at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
once to manifest itself. "You are Brandt," he said to
his visitor; then, breaking into a rapid and incoherent
babble, he repeated some verses from <cite>Zaire</cite>, in
which tragedy he had acted with Reverdil four years
before. Then he said, "You are Denize; you are Latour;"
two French actors who had been in his service;
and eventually addressed Reverdil by his right name.
These extravagances, or a profound silence, or questions
about the signs of a change which was incessantly
about to take place in his person, occupied
nearly three-fourths of the tête-à-tête, during the four
months that Reverdil was almost solely with the king,
either in his apartments, or driving out, with no other
suite but the postilion and a mounted lackey.</p>

<p>At times pride exalted the king; he had been
greeted like a god by the English nation; other kings
were eclipsed; it was too much wit that had turned his
head. At other times the king was oppressed and melancholy:
after all that he had done; after braving everything:
he would never be more than a "little man;"
that is to say, a weak and dependent man. He often
talked about killing, and asked Reverdil whether he
might not do so only once with impunity and without
scandal, or whether, if he did so, he would be hopelessly
wretched. On other occasions he pretended to
attack his own life. "Shall I drown myself?" he would
say; "shall I throw myself out of window, or dash
out my brains against the wall?" His object was to
alarm Reverdil, and by leaving him the choice, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
soon forgot this folly. Still it is true that he often desired
death, but feared it at the same time. One of
the amusements was pulling in a two-oared boat on
the small lake round the palace, and the poor king
often said to Reverdil, with the most unhappy face in
the world, "I should like to throw myself into the
lake and be pulled out again directly." His imagination
only found a refuge in a state of apathy, which
was the object of his hopes and desires. There were
three marked shades in his madness, which he indicated
by three German expressions.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> According to
the stage of his trouble, he often wound up his remarks
by saying, with a groan, "I am confused" (Ich
bin confus); or else, "There is a noise in my head" (Es
rappelt bei mir); or, lastly, "I am quite beside myself"
(Er ist ganz übergeschnappt). At times, his
muttered and confused remarks ended with the words,
"I can stand it no longer."</p>

<p>The king was evidently very unhappy; and honest
Reverdil was equally so. The latter usually passed
an hour with Christian after the dinner; and as he had
been his reader, the king, at times, put a book in his
hand, not to listen to what he read, but that he might
indulge in his own melancholy reveries, and talk to
himself in a low voice. The first book Reverdil took
up was a dictionary of celebrated men, marked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
history of Rizzio, the lover of Mary Stuart, assassinated
by Darnley, her husband. If this was the trick
of a valet, it failed in its effect, for the king never
listened. Besides, the king had not the slightest tendency
to jealousy, for he spoke twice to Reverdil about
a thing which would have aroused that feeling in any
other husband. Once he said that Struensee was the
queen's Cicisbeo; on another occasion, he asked his
visitor whether he believed that the King of Prussia
slept with Queen Matilda. "Why, who is the King
of Prussia?" Reverdil asked. "Oh! Struensee."
This way of designating the favourite proved, at any
rate, what power the latter possessed over the weak-minded
monarch.</p>

<p>The details which Reverdil gives us about the habits
of the court are very curious. When they did not go
hunting, they assembled to breakfast between eleven
and twelve o'clock. The king, the queen, Counts
Struensee and Brandt, with some of their male and
female favourites, were always present; and when the
state of the weather allowed it, breakfast was followed
by a walk, in which Struensee gave his arm to the
queen; the king, to the only maid-of-honour who was
admitted to this familiarity; each of the other gentlemen
to a lady; and chance did not decide the selection.
From time to time, the same party dined at
some summer-house, a distance away. Etiquette was
banished from these parties; and the newly-appointed
pages waited at table. They only entered when a bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
was rung, and left the room when they had done what
was wanted. On these excursions, the queen drove
out in the same carriage with the king and Struensee.
She placed herself between them at table; and if the
king misbehaved himself, Reverdil led him out of the
room. The queen even returned at night alone with
the favourite. This princess, who, on her arrival from
England, had been extremely affable and ingenious in
finding occasions to say agreeable things to everybody,
now only spoke with eagerness to the favourite; and if
before and after dinner she addressed any one, whether
male or female, Struensee was listening.</p>

<p>With this exception, the indecent tone supposed by the public did not
prevail in this company; they resembled the servants of a large house who
had sat down to table in their master's absence. A new comer must have
been struck by the familiar tone, and at seeing a court where there were
no great noblemen, and hardly any gentlemen.</p>

<p>Reverdil was astonished at not hearing a word about
the queen dowager and her son, who lived at Fredensborg,
about nine miles from Hirschholm. There
seemed a settled determination to keep Prince Frederick
apart from his brother; no appanage was
granted him, though it was full time to think about
it, nor was he initiated into affairs of state. Reverdil
resolved to do what he could to satisfy the queen
dowager by inducing the king to drive over and see
her; but the latter would not consent. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
estrangement came from Christian, and not from the
queen dowager.</p>

<p>We have seen how Prince Frederick was kept out
of the king's box at the play; and Brandt was blamed
for it, although it was done by the monarch's express
order. Equal anger was felt because Brandt did not
invite the prince to the private theatricals and dancing
which filled up a portion of the evenings at Hirschholm.
For this, so Reverdil says, Struensee was
mainly to blame. He had seen at London and
Berlin the princes paying their court to the king,
and mixing themselves up with the grandees in the
ante-chamber. On his return, he was shocked by the
old Danish fashion, by which the courtiers did not
come to the king's ante-room till they had paid their
respects to the royal princes and princesses, who were
thus placed on a level with the sovereign. He therefore
resolved to make Prince Frederick undergo these
humiliations until he had learned his duty.</p>

<p>It required a great occasion for the queen dowager
and her son to be invited, at lengthened intervals, to
dine at Hirschholm. When they arrived, they were
kept waiting; and the frigid reception granted them
left them but little doubt that their presence was disagreeable.
They were not angry with the king, and
did not explain this contempt by his caprices or his
indolent apathy, but they blamed the young queen
and her adherents. Hence serious aid frivolous subjects
combined to foment the misunderstanding in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
royal family and between relations. The lightest insults
are not those which hurt the least.</p>

<p>Serious complaints were being raised about this time
at the court of the queen dowager, in the capital and
the provinces, about the education of the prince royal,
or rather, because his education was not yet begun.
He was said to be left in the gardens of Hirschholm to
the inclemency of the seasons and his own imprudence,
with no other society but that of two lads of the lowest
rank. The most reasonable and the warmest patriots
said bitterly, that a retarded education was a great
fault in the case of a boy whose majority began at the
age of thirteen; as if the natural progress of a boy
could be accelerated in accordance with human institutions.</p>

<p>Such were the universal prejudice, and the language
of the most moderate men. At the court, on the contrary,
they were so satisfied with the method adopted,
that the queen and Struensee actually had drawings
made of the childish amusements of their young Emile,
which were engraved and published. He could be
seen in them entering his cold bath, playing at ball,
or using his little rake and spade. They fancied that
the entire universe would applaud this unique example
of a truly royal education.</p>

<p>The queen might be mistaken as to her son's education,
as it was carried on by a man of systems, but
she was an excellent mother, and paid as much attention
to her children as her position allowed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
on any rainy day the court was obliged to remain
in-doors, the queen did not fail to appear after dessert,
carrying her daughter on one of her arms, and leading
her son by the other hand, while his two little playmates
clung to her skirt. She seemed thoroughly to
enjoy the happiness of being a mother. The prince
was neither timid, nor indocile, nor fretful; but his
education was very much behindhand. At the age
of nearly four years, he did not yet know any language,
but had made a jargon of Danish and German,
which he had learned from his two playmates. The
conclusion at which Reverdil arrives, though displaying
an evident bias, is probably correct:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the temperature had been less damp; if the
young prince had had a sufficiently strong constitution
to withstand these trials; if an intelligent and
almost imperceptible but continued inspection had
caused his amusements to help in developing his reason,
this education would have been worth more than
that of all his ancestors."</p>

<p>But this inspection was not made, owing to the
jealousy of Struensee, who considered everything
badly done that did not pass through his hands, and
who had undertaken this inspection himself, like all the
rest, without reflecting that he already had a great deal
more work than he could do in the course of the day.</p>

of George II.:" "The king, talking of the people who had governed this
country in other times, said: 'King Charles, by his mistresses; King James,
by his priests; King William, by his men; and Queen Anne, by her women&mdash;favourites.
His father, he added, had been by anybody who could get at him.'
And at the end of this catalogue the heir of Dettingen asks: 'And who do
they say governs us now?' Sporus answers the question to himself and his
own satisfaction, by quoting four lines from a current lampoon, which are
handed down to posterity, and smash the small king's prestige:&mdash;</p>

fell foul of the king's remark, and denied its authenticity. But, I possess the
letter in which Lord G. Sackville stated it. So the invention, be it one, rests
with that nobleman, and not with my grandfather.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> This parallel at once proves the vital importance of Schleswig-Holstein to
the Danes. England could afford to lose Hanover, and was not sorry to do so,
as she thus escaped many German entanglements; but to Denmark the retention
of the duchies is a life question, both politically and materially. They
contain the sources of her power and prosperity; only so long as she retains
Schleswig-Holstein can she hold her ground as a second-class power; but from
the moment that she is forced to surrender the duchies, she will hopelessly sink
to the rank of a third or fourth rate power. Indeed, it is not improbable that
she would soon be absorbed altogether, for ere long, united Sweden and Norway
would annex this small isolated fraction of Scandinavian nationality.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> During Queen Louisa's life Frederick is supposed to have only once gone
astray with an Italian prima donna, the Scalabrini. The queen-mother, however,
had him supplanted in the lady's favour by Captain Detlev von Ahlefeldt,
a groom in waiting. When the king heard of it he was furious, kicked the
singing woman out at a moment's notice, and shut the unhappy captain up for
life in the fortress of Munkholm. The queen forgave her truant, and they lived
happy ever after, as the fairy stories say. No one cared, as it seemed, for
mamma's unhappy victim.</p></div>

it contains cannot be passed over by a searcher after the truth.</p></div>

Sophie Amalie, daughter of Paul Mothe, a surgeon. His daughter by his first
marriage, Friderike Luise, married, on July 21, 1720, Christian Augustus,
Duke of Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, which marriage plays an important
part in the Schleswig-Holstein polemics, as regards the legitimacy of the
Pretender. Christian, the present Duke of Augustenburg, as well as his
brother, Prince Frederick, also married Countesses of Danneskjold Samsöe.
A full account of the family will be found in vol. iv. of "Bülau's Geheime

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> General St. Germain had been summoned to Copenhagen by Frederick V.,
in 1761, when Peter III. raised a claim to the Gottorp portion of the duchy
united with the royal part of Schleswig, and menaced Denmark with a war
afloat and ashore. Saint Germain was appointed commander-in-chief, but
Catharine made a peace with Denmark on following her murdered husband on
the throne. In after life, Saint Germain was minister-at-war to Louis XVI.,
and caused general dissatisfaction, by trying to introduce the Prussian regulations
into the French army.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Son of the Landgrave Frederick II. of Hesse and Mary, daughter of
George II. of England. When his father embraced the Catholic faith, he, for
fear of contagion, was placed with his brothers under the guardianship of the
Protestant kings of Great Britain, Denmark, and Prussia. The county of
Hanau was given to their mother for their support; and when the war broke out
in Hanover, the boys were sent for greater security to Copenhagen, under the
protection of Frederick V., who had married Prince Charles's maternal aunt.
I shall have repeated occasions to allude to this prince.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> It has been mentioned that Caroline Matilda received, on parting from her
mother, a ring bearing the motto, "Bring me happiness." Four days after the
marriage the royal couple dined in state with two hundred guests, and it was
already observed that the rosy bloom on the young queen's cheeks had disappeared.
She was seen to look thoughtfully at her ring, and sigh heavily.
Her unhappiness showed itself more and more from day to day, while the
king appeared to take no notice of it. One day, when his favourite, Count
Holck, called Christian's attention to it, he replied, "Qu'importe? it is not
my fault; I believe that she has the spleen. Passons là dessus."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> According to the "Mémoires de mon Temps," Fran von Plessen took a
very high tone with everybody, and, like another Princess Ursini, claimed the
right of pointing the arrows which the ministers were to fire.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> According to the "Mémoires de mon Temps," this Princess was constantly
tormented by the king. At first she would smooth her ruffled plumes, and
smile on the king addressing her as the daughter of Frederick IV., but at last
things got so bad that she withdrew to her bedroom, and would not come to
meals. This cost the king and the royal family dear, for she left her large
property in estates and precious stones, not to the king, as she often declared
she would, but to the poor. The final cause of her withdrawal was a terrible
fright she received through Warnstedt, the king's first page, crawling into the
dining-room on all fours, disguised as a savage. What an idea this offers of
court life in those days!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The celebrated converter of Struensee. If we may believe a curious pamphlet

von Danneskjold Laurvig. She had risen from the vilest state of prostitution
to the rank of mistress of Sir John Goodricke, the English minister appointed
to Sweden, but whom French intrigues prevented from residing at Stockholm.
She was called, in consequence, <i>Milady</i>. At this time she was the very faithless
mistress of the Viennese envoy.</p></div>

girl burst through the double line of attendants, caught the King of
Denmark in her arms, and, kissing him heartily, said, "Now kill me if you
please, I can die contented, since I have kissed the prettiest fellow in the
world." The king, far from being offended, gently liberated himself from her
embrace, and ran, laughing and skipping, up-stairs.</p></div>

the Struensee family was as follows:&mdash;One of his ancestors, of quite a different
name, was, during the time of the Hanseatic League, a pilot of Lübeck. During
a frightful storm, in which no other man dared to venture out to sea, he brought
a richly laden fleet into port; acquired respect and credit in his native city for
doing so; and, in memory of his courageous deed, received from the Lübeck
magistracy the name of Strouvensee, which means a dark, stormy sea.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> In a tolerably impartial life of Struensee, published at Copenhagen while
he was under sentence of death, the following portrait is drawn of him:&mdash;"He
was a tall and very broad-shouldered fellow, almost of the height for the
Guards; was not ill-looking, had a rather long nose, a merry look, playful and
penetrating eyes, a free carriage, and sat his horse very well. Liberty followed
all his movements, and he was as little affected in the presence of the king and
among the courtiers, as if he were a born gentleman and had been educated at
court. In short, through the qualities of his mind and person he might have
been an amiable courtier and excellent statesman, if his heart had only been
better."</p></div>

wife of General von Gähler, and that the Russian, knowing that an ambassador
could not meet a doctor with the sword, took the cowardly revenge of inflicting
a severe castigation on Struensee with a cane&mdash;a mode of discipline to which he
had himself been often subjected at Petersburg. It is also stated by the same
author, that Frau von Gähler's motive for dismissing the Russian was, because
he refused to join the queen's party. If this is authentic, we may conclude
that the crafty envoy, even at that time, saw in the queen an opponent of the
Philo-Russian policy of the Copenhagen cabinet.</p></div>

Rantzau, for he said: "He is a most infamous man, a liar, a coward, a man capable,
from the meanest motives, of betraying his longest and best friends."
Cautious Sir R. M. Keith also judged Rantzau correctly, and wrote about him
in a letter to his father: "Count Rantzau, at this moment Lieutenant-General,
Confidential Councillor, Knight of the Queen's Order, &amp;c., would, if he had
lived within reach of Justice Fielding, have furnished matter for an Old Bailey
trial any one year of the last twenty of his life."</p></div>

capital. He obtained a decree from the king by which any creditor could
arrest his debtor if unable to pay. In a very short time the first gentlemen
in the land were seen flying to their country seats; among them was Count
von Laurvig, a man whose presence caused the favourite some alarm, and

sinned grievously against this sensible rule. The late king, and I dare say
the present, appointed surgeons, postmasters, custom-house officers, &amp;c.,
councillors of justice, although these gentry understood nothing of law, and
many a shopkeeper or farmer bears the title of war assessor, war councillor,
or chief commissary of war. The reason alleged for this by the government

governed like a mere province, there was only a Danish chancery for the two
kingdoms, and a German one for the duchies and counties.</p></div>

of Frederick VI. As is well known, he died of entire loss of strength; but on
the afternoon before his death, he gave the parole for the day in his audience-room.
While doing so, his three-cornered hat fell from his grasp; but he
would not allow any one to pick it up, but did so himself with the utmost
difficulty.</p></div>

was upon the road to this city, I heard of the downfall of a Monsieur de W&mdash;,
who had been in high favour with the sovereign, and raised from page to two
or three handsome posts at court. This young gentleman had fancied to himself
that he had become a man of importance, and began to vapour: when Struensee
dismissed the mighty Maréchal de la Cour, Chambellan, &amp;c., &amp;c., in a very
laughable manner, by creating him very unexpectedly lieutenant of Dragoons
in a regiment in Jütland! and sending him to his garrison with a small pension.
He became, probably, as awkward a lieutenant as he had been a courtier;
however, his military progress is again at a stand, as he was called back to town
yesterday (to my great amusement), and will immediately resume his functions
as a wag of the court!"</p></div>

a groom of the royal stud mounted on a yellow horse, generally handed him

done for a fête given to the Duke of Gloucester, on his paying his royal sister
a visit. The garden at Frederiksberg, which was much larger than that of
Rosenborg, was on that occasion magnificently illuminated and decorated, and
maskers visited it for three consecutive evenings.</p></div>

14, 1665, by Frederick III., the first absolute king of Denmark and
Sweden, but not published till after his death in 1709, raises the king above
the law, and makes him responsible to God alone for his actions as regent.
The only condition imposed on him was, that he should belong to the Protestant
religion, according to the Augsburg Confession. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lex Regia</i> remained
in force till June 5, 1849, the day on which the late King of Denmark, Frederick
VII., signed the democratic constitution of Denmark.</p></div>

every occasion, was yet weak enough to have this absurdity painted on his
coach panels, to dress his servants in red and white liveries, and to have his
coat of arms fastened on their caps. When his valet appeared for the first time
in this livery&mdash;so La Mothe, the queen's chamber-woman, tells us&mdash;he stumbled
on the palace stairs, his cap fell off his head and broke the badge, and the
blood that flowed from his nose thoroughly ruined the new livery. On Struensee
being told of this, he only gave his ordinary answer when anything disagreeable
to him happened "As God pleases." On this occasion, though, it
may have contained a deeper meaning.</p></div>

running the gauntlet in the army, by Frederick VI.</p></div>

allowed, although the king had given the example of such an alliance, and a
dispensation had always hitherto been granted. Nothing can be urged, however,
in favour of Struensee's permission for a man to marry his wife's niece, or
even sister.</p></div>

breach between Dane and German, which produced such a terrible catastrophe
in his case, has never since been healed, and it is in great measure owing to
thin jealousy, that the inhabitants of the duchies have had cause to complain
of their treatment by the triumphant, and, I fear, dictatorial, minority.</p></div>
